    <entry id="journal_page_text_22"><![CDATA[I am a beautiful thing, they say. Flawless as the sea of dunes. Graceful as the desert wind. Captivating as a shimmering mirage. They stare, they linger, they watch me without blinking.]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_title_23"><![CDATA[A Beautiful Thing (2/7)]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_23"><![CDATA[Such exquisiteness must be admired, they say. And so I am made to dance for their desperate, dust-pitted faces; for their watery, bloodshot eyes; their cracked, grinning lips. I am not a person to this debauched audience, I am an exotic wonder. I am a beautiful thing.]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_title_24"><![CDATA[A Beautiful Thing (3/7)]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_24"><![CDATA[Such loveliness belongs in the palace, they say. And so my hands are tied, and I am put in a caravan next to golden idols and jeweled icons. Together, we are a priceless cargo of dazzling rarities, bound for the Vizier's treasury. I know this tyrant's reputation, and I am afraid.]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_title_25"><![CDATA[A Beautiful Thing (4/7)]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_25"><![CDATA[As the wagon careens along the mountain road, I make my choice. I will not go to the Vizier. I will not be this man’s prize; his plaything. With practiced grace, I slip my bonds, and lunge for the open air. The wagon teeters and the guard shouts. Wheels lift, horses panic...]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_title_26"><![CDATA[A Beautiful Thing (5/7)]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_26"><![CDATA[I am lodged in a jumble of corpses and wreckage. My arm is pinned. The serpent appears silently from behind a rock, tongue tasting the air. The bite is quick; the venom slow. It runs cold in my veins, inching up my arm - forcing me to make a terrible choice.]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_title_27"><![CDATA[A Beautiful Thing (6/7)]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_27"><![CDATA[The knife is dull, and I must work quickly. In my panic, I saw, hack, and gouge. My cries are met with the silent indifference of the dunes, the chill of the desert wind, the cold light of the moon. I am sacrificing my beauty for a chance to live; paying for my future with the only currency I’ve ever had.]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_title_28"><![CDATA[A Beautiful Thing (7/7)]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_28"><![CDATA[I stare at my severed hand, my bloodied arm. There will be no more leering crowds, no more coins thrown at my feet. I breathe a wordless thanks to my liberator, as it slithers away into the shadows. At last, I am free of my gilded cage. At last, I finally understand: a thing cannot be truly beautiful until it is broken.]]></entry>

    <entry id="journal_page_text_29"><![CDATA[(The journal entry is written in a very fine and elegant cursive) To whomever may be the reader. This is a private journal. Please refrain from reading any further and return this item to its rightful owner. You may find me using the map provided. Thank you. Signed, Euryale (Attached is a detailed map of the Hamlet. However, the directions given have been smudged and are unreadable)]]></entry>

    <entry id="journal_page_text_30"><![CDATA[(The journal entry is written in a very fine and elegant cursive) It's been quite some time since I've stepped foot in this grand city. Much has changed in my absence. The miserly workers had been replaced with cheerful men and women talking of the most recent battles in the king's arena. They also talk of a valiant champion who will be fighting in the arena later in the day. I tried to brush off the chatter but as I wandered about, all I heard was more and more of this man's heroic feats. With my interest peaked, I'll be making my way to the gladiatorial ring soon.]]></entry>

    <entry id="journal_page_text_31"><![CDATA[(The journal entry is written in a very fine and elegant cursive) Typical. I took a wrong turn on my way to the arena and ended up in a rather droll part of the city which served as a home to many vulgar and unscrupulous individuals. It was only predictable that I would be stopped by a group of these thugs looking to strip me of my belongings. A rather poor choice of words and hands that touched places they shouldn't have resulted in an unpleasant series of events that took up more of my time than I had hoped. The praised hero would begin his fight soon so I hastily picked up my mirror and made my way to the coliseum.]]></entry>

    <entry id="journal_page_text_32"><![CDATA[(The journal entry is written in a very fine and elegant cursive) I just barely made it in time for the battle. Luckily one of the guards was kind enough to procure me a seat where I could best spectate the skirmish. As the gates opened, a single man emerged and I sat amongst the crowd in awe.]]></entry>

    <entry id="journal_page_text_33"><![CDATA[(The journal entry is written in a very fine and elegant cursive) The audience cheered in excitement. The warrior was the physical embodiment of perfection. His chiseled body told of a man who had seen rigorous battles while his long flowing hair would have many believe he was born from the gods. In one hand he held a fisherman's net and in the other an ornate trident. He was so perfect that I had reason to believe he had attained his beauty through obscure means, just as I had.]]></entry>

    <entry id="journal_page_text_34"><![CDATA[(The journal entry is written in a very fine and elegant cursive) Amongst the crowd's cheering admiration, the hero's adversary appeared. On the opposite side of the arena, a rusted gate opened and what emerged was a behemoth pulled in chains by beastmasters. It was a creature from a children's tale. A hulking monster covered in iron spikes and decorated with scars. The citizens greeted this thing with mocking shouts and vulgar insults. Despite this menacing beast, the champion did not show an ounce of fear, but instead smirked with confidence.]]></entry>

    <entry id="journal_page_text_35"><![CDATA[(The journal entry is written in a very fine and elegant cursive) The beastmasters released their chains and the battle began. At first I had my doubts. The monster was the size of ten men and shook the earth with every step. How could any man possibly hope to defeat such a thing? But to my surprise, the hero was succeeding. The fight looked more like a dance, with the agile warrior dodging the ogre's clumsy strikes. He stabbed at it with masterful precision and weaved around the behemoth as it mindlessly swung its boulder fists around in frustration.]]></entry>

    <entry id="journal_page_text_36"><![CDATA[(The journal entry is written in a very fine and elegant cursive) In a spectacular display, the champion thrusted his trident into the heart of the beast, causing blood to spill forth and sending the crowd into a raucous frenzy. With a loud thud, the creature collapsed and its defiling blood soaked the soil around it. The crowd continued to cheer and applaud as the hero took in their admiration. He bravely walked to the massive corpse and planted one foot on top of its metallic head. He waved to the crowd and I could have sworn he had turned to me and winked. My heart skipped a beat.]]></entry>

    <entry id="journal_page_text_37"><![CDATA[(The journal entry is written in a very fine and elegant cursive) It all happened so quickly. Our admiration quickly turned to horror as the beast revealed that it was still alive. The creature caught the hero's leg in an iron grip. It pulled the man to the ground and, with its other fist, it slammed down on the champion's face. A single scream was all we heard as the behemoth smashed the man's head and splattered bits of him all around. It slowly stood back up, covered in the gore of its victim. A moment of shock soon shifted to panic and anguish as the torn crowd began to demand justice.]]></entry>

    <entry id="journal_page_text_38"><![CDATA[(The journal entry is written in a very fine and elegant cursive) The crowd entered a vengeful frenzy as they shouted for the guards. I quickly took my leave and the last thing I saw was the beast running rampant on the beastmasters that tried to subdue it. Even as I hastily made my way out of the amphitheater's gates, I could still hear the frantic shouts of the crowd and the trembling of the earth itself. It had been interesting returning to my city of origin, but I sense a riot will soon break out and I plan to depart long before it has any effect on me.]]></entry>

    <entry id="journal_page_text_39"><![CDATA[I've been told that keeping a journal can help take my mind off the lingering dread that this wretched place can invite, so I might as well start now. We have been tasked with exploring a portion of the wealds, a place that brings back many unpleasant memories but one that I know better than anyone. I will be accompanied by Turid and Aldwin. While Turid can be brash sometimes and Aldwin reckless, they make for an effective and reliable crew. Also assigned to us is a new face, one that troubles me...]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_40"><![CDATA[We've embarked on our mission and I've already got a bad feeling. Not one hour from leaving and the new blood is already complaining. Too much walking she says, too much dirt she says. Worst is she comes to the expedition dressed in a fancy robe and wielding a broken mirror. What's her reasoning for such strange equipment? She says its "comfortable". I'll never understand these city-folk...]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_41"><![CDATA[Our first encounter in this wretched place almost ended in disaster, but the recruit pulled through. Turns out she's some witch, using her broke mirror to conjure some healing magic. Made Turid right as rain when he got stabbed by some cultist. Aldwin has taken a liking to her, but I've grown suspicious...]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_42"><![CDATA[Everything is going smoothly. I sit and write this as we rest by the campfire. The witch lady is trading compliments with Turid, some rubbish I'll never understand. Have to admit, even for a damsel raised in the cities, she is extraordinarily beautiful. Flawless skin with a soothing voice. The only thing wrong is that damn mirror of hers. Shattered and scratched up like its older than her. Very strange...]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_43"><![CDATA[Damn brigands ambushed us in the night. Different lot than the one I used to run with but their behaviour was no different. Poor Aldwin was the first victim, one of the brutes stabbed him right in the gut and sliced him open. He died laying in a pool of his own blood. Before I could even grab my bow, one of their rangers blasted my arm. Completely mangled, I'll be no use to anyone in this state. They went straight for the witch, poor thing had just woken up. I thought that'd be the end for her but I couldn't be more wrong...]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_44"><![CDATA[The damned witch dropped her mirror to reveal her hideous form. A mess of tentacle, maw, and spit, screeching at her would-be assailants. Turid ran screaming just from the sight of the thing. When one of the cutthroats took a swing at the creature, it moved with impossible speed and vomited a putrid bile from its many mouths. The poor fools screamed in agony as their flesh melted from their bones until all that remained was a puddle of boiling blood. That alone was enough to send the whole band of thugs running, and in that moment the monstrosity turned its gaze to me. Pure instinct kicked in and I ran as fast as I could into the darkness...]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_45"><![CDATA[The wound is infected. I'm having hallucinations. My damned bird flew away during that terrible encounter and hasn't returned. I can only assume Turid has suffered the same fate as Aldwin. To think this is the way it would end, huddled under a tree haunted by the memories of that unspeakable creature. I thought I'd be redeemed for my sins, but instead I die forgotten like so many other countless souls. I thought I was ready to fight the horrors, but now I know better...]]></entry>

    <entry id="journal_page_text_53"><![CDATA[I tracked my latest hunt to the grand city. This one will be illusive, its behaviour suggests that it prefers manipulation over direct confrontation. It'll be difficult to identify the creature, given the degeneracy of this city's populace, but I will not give up my search. The Light guides me.]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_54"><![CDATA[I've found the hag. I over-estimated its intelligence, it had made itself easy to find based on its arrogant nature and abhorrent flaunting. I've announced its debaucheries to the entirety of the city populace and the hunt will soon begin.]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_55"><![CDATA[The creature fled into the foul shantytowns that sit in the city's shadow. I cannot allow such a thing to exist, so I set the entirety of the corrupted dwellings ablaze. With nowhere to run, it will surely burn for its sins.]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_56"><![CDATA[Many charred corpses were found amongst the aftermath. They are unrecognizable but I am sure that the witch can be included among them. Despite my radical actions, the cityfolk do not seem to care for those lost in the fire. Surely they must understand as I do that the loss of these peasants is a small price to pay for the eradication of evil. And so, with another monster put down for good, I continue my crusade against corruption.]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_57"><![CDATA[This will surely mark me down in the manuscripts as a hero of the Light! We have captured the heretical witch that had splintered our faith. I will be responsible for her execution, and there is no punishment more fitting for a false prophet than death by holy fire.]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_58"><![CDATA[To see the witch with my own eyes is to know pure corruption. There is no doubt that this thing is responsible for splitting the faithful followers of the Light into conflicted factions. It speaks as if it is a disciple of the Light like us, but I see through her ruse. I will commence the burning shortly.]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_59"><![CDATA[It is an abomination unlike any I've encountered! It extinguished the sanctioned fires of the pyre with ease and presented itself as an avatar of the Flame. It had converted all around me to its falsified fate and I watched in horror as both peasants and crusaders of the Light bowed in unison to this creature of debased prophecies. I retreated from its deformed presence, and now I must warn those that are still pure of its corrupting nature.]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_60"><![CDATA[The worst thing has come to reality. The creature proved too strong, and now all have come to worship it as a demigod. I have been excommunicated from what was once a faith that fought the darkness but now is a cult praising a thing that mockingly resembles an angel. Even in the face of defeat, I will not stop my hunt. This thing must die, or mankind will be damned for eternity.]]></entry>

    <entry id="journal_page_text_61"><![CDATA[Our plan is in motion. No longer will we be the weakest of the kingdoms. The sea fiends of the west and the warmongers of the north will fear us. They will know that we are the rightful rulers of this land. We are perfect beings, so it is our destiny to rule over all.]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_62"><![CDATA[Beauty can be found in the most unlikely of places. On our travels through the peasant countryside, we stumbled upon two perfect flowers. Mirror copies of each other, with unnatural beauty and poise. It is not right to leave something so precious in the filth of the common people, so we took them in. They will be a quintessential piece to our plan.]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_63"><![CDATA[They took quickly to our ways. They are a legend born in flesh. The Twin Flowers, one that trains in war, another that trains in diplomacy. Their technique is flawless, perfected, and we are eager to see disciples follow their ways. Our army forms quickly. Within years, we will have an army of perfect warriors, trained by the dual embodiment of perfection.]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_64"><![CDATA[It has been months of rigorous training, but we are beginning to see results. The Twin Flowers are training our mortal soldiers into godly disciples. The Warrior is strict, selective, only training young men with skin as flawless as hers. She says that her technique must be matched with unearthly beauty. We do not doubt her, for we cannot begin to comprehend the lessons of a perfect being. Many soldiers have fallen from the intense training, but we know that those that survive and persevere will ascend, and vanquish our foes.]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_65"><![CDATA[This plan was decades in the making, and finally the fruits of our labor can be harvested! The Twin Flowers’ first performance was grandeur. The north kingdom could not withstand our assault. The Warrior was as graceful as she is beautiful. Dancing across the battlefield, painting the dirt with our foes’ blood as our perfect soldiers followed in her path. Our flawless army triumphed this day and they will triumph for many more. Our enemies will finally know fear, and they will bow to us in time. We prepare for celebration, tonight will be a night remembered forever.]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_66"><![CDATA[A terrible tragedy has befell us. The Twin Flowers are no more. One was found, surrounded by the corpses of our finest warriors, naked and splayed out in a pool of her own blood. The other Flower was nowhere to be found. Spiteful maledictions were posted all around the room, surely some sorcery by our most hated enemy. They knew they couldn’t fight us directly, so they sent infiltrators to kill us when we were most vulnerable. This will not be our end. We will find the lost flower, and we will rebuild our army. ]]></entry>

    <entry id="journal_page_text_67"><![CDATA[Damn it, one of the damsels escaped. Ascot must have tied the knots wrong and now the wench is out in the woods, that idiot. Mother is sending me with Jarret and Mavis to track her down. It is unsurprising, really. My day ruined by the actions of a brain dead oaf. Maybe I’ll stab him in the sack to teach him a lesson once I return.]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_68"><![CDATA[We found the maiden, but Jarret and Mavis got carried away with the hunt and killed the girl. Irritating. I returned to Mother immediately to tell her. She was furious. She gathered up the lot of us after Jarret and Mavis returned to make an example of them. “A life for a life”, she always says. Had the two of them fight to the death. They ended up killing each other. Jarret had his guts splayed out while Mavis got his skull crushed. Gruesome scene, but that’s two more jackasses I won’t have to deal with.]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_69"><![CDATA[I am being sent by Mother on another hunt. This time we’re taking us one of those “exotic” women from the east. They’re passing through here soon and I am in charge of tracking this one. That useless cockroach Ascot is coming along. He is only dead weight to me. He will be good fodder at the very least.]]></entry>	
    <entry id="journal_page_text_70"><![CDATA[We got the girl, but at heavy cost. The damn guards used some foreign fighting technique, nothing I’ve ever seen before. Caught us off guard but we outnumbered them. Ascot died in the ambush, only good thing to come of this. The damn wench doesn’t even speak sense, talking in some foreign tongue. Had to slap some quiet into her. This one better be worth whatever Mother is getting. This is more work than I prefer in a single day, and it is putting me in a worse mood.]]></entry>	
    <entry id="journal_page_text_71"><![CDATA[We brought her back to Mother, and she sent us to meet up with the lot that asked for this foreign sheep in the first place. A bunch of nobles they are. The head of them has an “acquired” taste for imported goods and is offering us bountiful amounts of food, weapons, armor, whatever we want, for this fragile thing. I will be there to oversee the trade. ]]></entry>	
    <entry id="journal_page_text_72"><![CDATA[That contemptible whorish excuse for human cattle. That slit-eyed profligate grabbed hold of my damned hood. I knocked her right off her feet like the harlot she is and she hit her pretty little head on a table. Now her blood is on my hands and Mother wants revenge. I ran as fast as I could out of there. I am not dying for some debauched little waif.]]></entry>	
    <entry id="journal_page_text_73"><![CDATA[It has been weeks, maybe even months. I lost track ever since the first hunting parties found me. That crazed hag never forgets a grudge. “A life for a life.” Nothing but deranged drivel from that witch. I never believed in her preachings, I was just in it for my own gain. Now she’s sending more and more thugs to take my head. I am better than all of them. I’ve racked up a kill count that should be feared, and it only grows with each perilous encounter.]]></entry>	
    <entry id="journal_page_text_74"><![CDATA[This is tiring. That psychotic harpy continues to send more and more of her kin to hunt me down. I cannot live like this, in constant peril of the next ambush. It is time that I find a place to hide. Maybe life as a mercenary for a noble family will suffice. Best that those pompous fools die instead me when the time comes, after all...]]></entry>

    <entry id="journal_page_text_75"><![CDATA[(The page is dirty and barely legible) They slaughtered all the men. My husband, my brother, even my own son. They have us all tied up, ready for whatever cruel fate they wish to inflict on us. They are slavers. I have heard of what happened to the neighboring clans, and we have become their next victims. I pray that we will be rescued soon, I cannot imagine what will become of me in this hellish place.]]></entry>	
    <entry id="journal_page_text_76"><![CDATA[(The page is dirty and barely legible) They treat us worse than cattle. We are given dirt to eat and left soiled. The women that have not been sold off are here with me, rotting away and wishing for death. The birds surround us, eager to feast on our broken bodies, but I feel a connection. They ask for a sacrifice in exchange for freedom. They want to know that I am willing to give. The others yell and kick them away, but I allow them to approach me. They ask for my arm’s flesh, and in exchange they will loosen my bonds. I accept.]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_77"><![CDATA[(The page is dirty and barely legible) Released of my bonds, I did not free the others. They refused the gifts of the flock and do not deserve the blessings I was bestowed. I carved a path of bodies as I made my way to the leader of this slavers’ group, the first of many offerings I will make to my new found family. When I finally found their leader, I did not hesitate to gouge his eyes out and leave him as one final offering for the first feast of my flock.]]></entry>	
    <entry id="journal_page_text_78"><![CDATA[(The page is dirty and barely legible) As for those left, I gave them a simple choice. Stay and become part of our flock, or deny us and become our offering. Many refused, and were made examples of. For those who stayed, I made it clear what we stood for. The cycle of life and death is all that matters. A life for a life is the cost for transgression. Every death is an offering, and so long as that one rule is kept, I will respect their way of life. We are shepherds for the weak, and those deemed unworthy will become an offering to our flock.]]></entry>

    <entry id="journal_page_text_22"><![CDATA[I am a beautiful thing, they say. Flawless as the sea of dunes. Graceful as the desert wind. Captivating as a shimmering mirage. They stare, they linger, they watch me without blinking.]]></entry>

    <entry id="journal_page_text_23"><![CDATA[Such exquisiteness must be admired, they say. And so I am made to dance for their desperate, dust-pitted faces; for their watery, bloodshot eyes; their cracked, grinning lips. I am not a person to this debauched audience, I am an exotic wonder. I am a beautiful thing.]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_title_24"><![CDATA[A Beautiful Thing (3/7)]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_24"><![CDATA[Such loveliness belongs in the palace, they say. And so my hands are tied, and I am put in a caravan next to golden idols and jeweled icons. Together, we are a priceless cargo of dazzling rarities, bound for the Vizier's treasury. I know this tyrant's reputation, and I am afraid.]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_title_25"><![CDATA[A Beautiful Thing (4/7)]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_25"><![CDATA[As the wagon careens along the mountain road, I make my choice. I will not go to the Vizier. I will not be this man’s prize; his plaything. With practiced grace, I slip my bonds, and lunge for the open air. The wagon teeters and the guard shouts. Wheels lift, horses panic...]]></entry>

    <entry id="journal_page_text_26"><![CDATA[I am lodged in a jumble of corpses and wreckage. My arm is pinned. The serpent appears silently from behind a rock, tongue tasting the air. The bite is quick; the venom slow. It runs cold in my veins, inching up my arm - forcing me to make a terrible choice.]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_title_27"><![CDATA[A Beautiful Thing (6/7)]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_27"><![CDATA[The knife is dull, and I must work quickly. In my panic, I saw, hack, and gouge. My cries are met with the silent indifference of the dunes, the chill of the desert wind, the cold light of the moon. I am sacrificing my beauty for a chance to live; paying for my future with the only currency I’ve ever had.]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_title_28"><![CDATA[A Beautiful Thing (7/7)]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_28"><![CDATA[I stare at my severed hand, my bloodied arm. There will be no more leering crowds, no more coins thrown at my feet. I breathe a wordless thanks to my liberator, as it slithers away into the shadows. At last, I am free of my gilded cage. At last, I finally understand: a thing cannot be truly beautiful until it is broken.]]></entry>

    <entry id="journal_page_text_29"><![CDATA[(The journal entry is written in a very fine and elegant cursive) To whomever may be the reader. This is a private journal. Please refrain from reading any further and return this item to its rightful owner. You may find me using the map provided. Thank you. Signed, Euryale (Attached is a detailed map of the Hamlet. However, the directions given have been smudged and are unreadable)]]></entry>

    <entry id="journal_page_text_30"><![CDATA[(The journal entry is written in a very fine and elegant cursive) It's been quite some time since I've stepped foot in this grand city. Much has changed in my absence. The miserly workers had been replaced with cheerful men and women talking of the most recent battles in the king's arena. They also talk of a valiant champion who will be fighting in the arena later in the day. I tried to brush off the chatter but as I wandered about, all I heard was more and more of this man's heroic feats. With my interest peaked, I'll be making my way to the gladiatorial ring soon.]]></entry>

    <entry id="journal_page_text_31"><![CDATA[(The journal entry is written in a very fine and elegant cursive) Typical. I took a wrong turn on my way to the arena and ended up in a rather droll part of the city which served as a home to many vulgar and unscrupulous individuals. It was only predictable that I would be stopped by a group of these thugs looking to strip me of my belongings. A rather poor choice of words and hands that touched places they shouldn't have resulted in an unpleasant series of events that took up more of my time than I had hoped. The praised hero would begin his fight soon so I hastily picked up my mirror and made my way to the coliseum.]]></entry>

    <entry id="journal_page_text_32"><![CDATA[(The journal entry is written in a very fine and elegant cursive) I just barely made it in time for the battle. Luckily one of the guards was kind enough to procure me a seat where I could best spectate the skirmish. As the gates opened, a single man emerged and I sat amongst the crowd in awe.]]></entry>

    <entry id="journal_page_text_33"><![CDATA[(The journal entry is written in a very fine and elegant cursive) The audience cheered in excitement. The warrior was the physical embodiment of perfection. His chiseled body told of a man who had seen rigorous battles while his long flowing hair would have many believe he was born from the gods. In one hand he held a fisherman's net and in the other an ornate trident. He was so perfect that I had reason to believe he had attained his beauty through obscure means, just as I had.]]></entry>

    <entry id="journal_page_text_34"><![CDATA[(The journal entry is written in a very fine and elegant cursive) Amongst the crowd's cheering admiration, the hero's adversary appeared. On the opposite side of the arena, a rusted gate opened and what emerged was a behemoth pulled in chains by beastmasters. It was a creature from a children's tale. A hulking monster covered in iron spikes and decorated with scars. The citizens greeted this thing with mocking shouts and vulgar insults. Despite this menacing beast, the champion did not show an ounce of fear, but instead smirked with confidence.]]></entry>

    <entry id="journal_page_text_35"><![CDATA[(The journal entry is written in a very fine and elegant cursive) The beastmasters released their chains and the battle began. At first I had my doubts. The monster was the size of ten men and shook the earth with every step. How could any man possibly hope to defeat such a thing? But to my surprise, the hero was succeeding. The fight looked more like a dance, with the agile warrior dodging the ogre's clumsy strikes. He stabbed at it with masterful precision and weaved around the behemoth as it mindlessly swung its boulder fists around in frustration.]]></entry>

    <entry id="journal_page_text_36"><![CDATA[(The journal entry is written in a very fine and elegant cursive) In a spectacular display, the champion thrusted his trident into the heart of the beast, causing blood to spill forth and sending the crowd into a raucous frenzy. With a loud thud, the creature collapsed and its defiling blood soaked the soil around it. The crowd continued to cheer and applaud as the hero took in their admiration. He bravely walked to the massive corpse and planted one foot on top of its metallic head. He waved to the crowd and I could have sworn he had turned to me and winked. My heart skipped a beat.]]></entry>

    <entry id="journal_page_text_37"><![CDATA[(The journal entry is written in a very fine and elegant cursive) It all happened so quickly. Our admiration quickly turned to horror as the beast revealed that it was still alive. The creature caught the hero's leg in an iron grip. It pulled the man to the ground and, with its other fist, it slammed down on the champion's face. A single scream was all we heard as the behemoth smashed the man's head and splattered bits of him all around. It slowly stood back up, covered in the gore of its victim. A moment of shock soon shifted to panic and anguish as the torn crowd began to demand justice.]]></entry>

    <entry id="journal_page_text_38"><![CDATA[(The journal entry is written in a very fine and elegant cursive) The crowd entered a vengeful frenzy as they shouted for the guards. I quickly took my leave and the last thing I saw was the beast running rampant on the beastmasters that tried to subdue it. Even as I hastily made my way out of the amphitheater's gates, I could still hear the frantic shouts of the crowd and the trembling of the earth itself. It had been interesting returning to my city of origin, but I sense a riot will soon break out and I plan to depart long before it has any effect on me.]]></entry>

    <entry id="journal_page_text_39"><![CDATA[I've been told that keeping a journal can help take my mind off the lingering dread that this wretched place can invite, so I might as well start now. We have been tasked with exploring a portion of the wealds, a place that brings back many unpleasant memories but one that I know better than anyone. I will be accompanied by Turid and Aldwin. While Turid can be brash sometimes and Aldwin reckless, they make for an effective and reliable crew. Also assigned to us is a new face, one that troubles me...]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_40"><![CDATA[We've embarked on our mission and I've already got a bad feeling. Not one hour from leaving and the new blood is already complaining. Too much walking she says, too much dirt she says. Worst is she comes to the expedition dressed in a fancy robe and wielding a broken mirror. What's her reasoning for such strange equipment? She says its "comfortable". I'll never understand these city-folk...]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_41"><![CDATA[Our first encounter in this wretched place almost ended in disaster, but the recruit pulled through. Turns out she's some witch, using her broke mirror to conjure some healing magic. Made Turid right as rain when he got stabbed by some cultist. Aldwin has taken a liking to her, but I've grown suspicious...]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_42"><![CDATA[Everything is going smoothly. I sit and write this as we rest by the campfire. The witch lady is trading compliments with Turid, some rubbish I'll never understand. Have to admit, even for a damsel raised in the cities, she is extraordinarily beautiful. Flawless skin with a soothing voice. The only thing wrong is that damn mirror of hers. Shattered and scratched up like its older than her. Very strange...]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_43"><![CDATA[Damn brigands ambushed us in the night. Different lot than the one I used to run with but their behaviour was no different. Poor Aldwin was the first victim, one of the brutes stabbed him right in the gut and sliced him open. He died laying in a pool of his own blood. Before I could even grab my bow, one of their rangers blasted my arm. Completely mangled, I'll be no use to anyone in this state. They went straight for the witch, poor thing had just woken up. I thought that'd be the end for her but I couldn't be more wrong...]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_44"><![CDATA[The damned witch dropped her mirror to reveal her hideous form. A mess of tentacle, maw, and spit, screeching at her would-be assailants. Turid ran screaming just from the sight of the thing. When one of the cutthroats took a swing at the creature, it moved with impossible speed and vomited a putrid bile from its many mouthes. The poor fools screamed in agony as their flesh melted from their bones until all that remained was a puddle of boiling blood. That alone was enough to send the whole band of thugs running, and in that moment the monstrosity turned its gaze to me. Pure instinct kicked in and I ran as fast as I could into the darkness...]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_45"><![CDATA[The wound is infected. I'm having hallucinations. My damned bird flew away during that terrible encounter and hasn't returned. I can only assume Turid has suffered the same fate as Aldwin. To think this is the way it would end, huddled under a tree haunted by the memories of that unspeakable creature. I thought I'd be redeemed for my sins, but instead I die forgotten like so many other countless souls. I thought I was ready to fight the horrors, but now I know better...]]></entry>

    <entry id="journal_page_text_53"><![CDATA[I tracked my latest hunt to the grand city. This one will be illusive, its behaviour suggests that it prefers manipulation over direct confrontation. It'll be difficult to identify the creature, given the degeneracy of this city's populace, but I will not give up my search. The Light guides me.]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_54"><![CDATA[I've found the hag. I over-estimated its intelligence, it had made itself easy to find based on its arrogant nature and abhorrent flaunting. I've announced its debaucheries to the entirety of the city populace and the hunt will soon begin.]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_55"><![CDATA[The creature fled into the foul shantytowns that sit in the city's shadow. I cannot allow such a thing to exist, so I set the entirety of the corrupted dwellings ablaze. With nowhere to run, it will surely burn for its sins.]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_56"><![CDATA[Many charred corpses were found amongst the aftermath. They are unrecognizable but I am sure that the witch can be included among them. Despite my radical actions, the cityfolk do not seem to care for those lost in the fire. Surely they must understand as I do that the loss of these peasants is a small price to pay for the eradication of evil. And so, with another monster put down for good, I continue my crusade against corruption.]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_57"><![CDATA[This will surely mark me down in the manuscripts as a hero of the Light! We have captured the heretical witch that had splintered our faith. I will be responsible for her execution, and there is no punishment more fitting for a false prophet than death by holy fire.]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_58"><![CDATA[To see the witch with my own eyes is to know pure corruption. There is no doubt that this thing is responsible for splitting the faithful followers of the Light into conflicted factions. It speaks as if it is a disciple of the Light like us, but I see through her ruse. I will commence the burning shortly.]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_59"><![CDATA[It is an abomination unlike any I've encountered! It extinguished the sanctioned fires of the pyre with ease and presented itself as an avatar of the Flame. It had converted all around me to its falsified fate and I watched in horror as both peasants and crusaders of the Light bowed in unison to this creature of debased prophecies. I retreated from its deformed presence, and now I must warn those that are still pure of its corrupting nature.]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_60"><![CDATA[The worst thing has come to reality. The creature proved too strong, and now all have come to worship it as a demigod. I have been excommunicated from what was once a faith that fought the darkness but now is a cult praising a thing that mockingly resembles an angel. Even in the face of defeat, I will not stop my hunt. This thing must die, or mankind will be damned for eternity.]]></entry>

    <entry id="journal_page_text_61"><![CDATA[Our plan is in motion. No longer will we be the weakest of the kingdoms. The sea fiends of the west and the warmongers of the north will fear us. They will know that we are the rightful rulers of this land. We are perfect beings, so it is our destiny to rule over all.]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_62"><![CDATA[Beauty can be found in the most unlikely of places. On our travels through the peasant countryside, we stumbled upon two perfect flowers. Mirror copies of each other, with unnatural beauty and poise. It is not right to leave something so precious in the filth of the common people, so we took them in. They will be a quintessential piece to our plan.]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_63"><![CDATA[They took quickly to our ways. They are a legend born in flesh. The Twin Flowers, one that trains in war, another that trains in diplomacy. Their technique is flawless, perfected, and we are eager to see disciples follow their ways. Our army forms quickly. Within years, we will have an army of perfect warriors, trained by the dual embodiment of perfection.]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_64"><![CDATA[It has been months of rigorous training, but we are beginning to see results. The Twin Flowers are training our mortal soldiers into godly disciples. The Warrior is a strict, selective, only training young men with skin as flawless as hers. She says that her technique must be matched with unearthly beauty. We do not doubt her, for we cannot begin to comprehend the lessons of a perfect being. Many soldiers have fallen from the intense training, but we know that those that survive and persevere will ascend, and vanquish our foes.]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_65"><![CDATA[This plan was decades in the making, and finally the fruits of our labor can be harvested! The Twin Flowers’ first performance was grandeur. The north kingdom could not withstand our assault. The Warrior was as graceful as she is beautiful. Dancing across the battlefield, painting the dirt with our foes’ blood as our perfect soldiers followed in her path. Our flawless army triumphed this day and they will triumph for many more. Our enemies will finally know fear, and they will bow to us in time. We prepare for celebration, tonight will be a night remembered forever.]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_66"><![CDATA[A terrible tragedy has befell us. The Twin Flowers are no more. One was found, surrounded by the corpses of our finest warriors, naked and splayed out in a pool of her own blood. The other Flower was nowhere to be found. Spiteful maledictions were posted all around the room, surely some sorcery by our most hated enemy. They knew they couldn’t fight us directly, so they sent infiltrators to kill us when we were most vulnerable. This will not be our end. We will find the lost flower, and we will rebuild our army. ]]></entry>

    <entry id="journal_page_text_67"><![CDATA[Damn it, one of the damsels escaped. Ascot must have tied the knots wrong and now the wench is out in the woods, that idiot. Mother is sending me with Jarret and Mavis to track her down. It is unsurprising, really. My day ruined by the actions of a brain dead oaf. Maybe I’ll stab him in the sack to teach him a lesson once I return.]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_68"><![CDATA[We found the maiden, but Jarret and Mavis got carried away with the hunt and killed the girl. Irritating. I returned to Mother immediately to tell her. She was furious. She gathered up the lot of us after Jarret and Mavis returned to make an example of them. “A life for a life”, she always says. Had the two of them fight to the death. They ended up killing each other. Jarret had his guts splayed out while Mavis got his skull crushed. Gruesome scene, but that’s two more jackasses I won’t have to deal with.]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_69"><![CDATA[I am being sent by Mother on another hunt. This time we’re taking us one of those “exotic” women from the east. They’re passing through here soon and I am in charge of tracking this one. That useless cockroach Ascot is coming along. He is only dead weight to me. He will be good fodder at the very least.]]></entry>	
    <entry id="journal_page_text_70"><![CDATA[We got the girl, but at heavy cost. The damn guards used some foreign fighting technique, nothing I’ve ever seen before. Caught us off guard but we outnumbered them. Ascot died in the ambush, only good thing to come of this. The damn wench doesn’t even speak sense, talking in some foreign tongue. Had to slap some quiet into her. This one better be worth whatever Mother is getting. This is more work than I prefer in a single day, and it is putting me in a worse mood.]]></entry>	
    <entry id="journal_page_text_71"><![CDATA[We brought her back to Mother, and she sent us to meet up with the lot that asked for this foreign sheep in the first place. A bunch of nobles they are. The head of them has an “acquired” taste for imported goods and is offering us bountiful amounts of food, weapons, armor, whatever we want, for this fragile thing. I will be there to oversee the trade. ]]></entry>	
    <entry id="journal_page_text_72"><![CDATA[That contemptible whorish excuse for human cattle. That slit-eyed profligate grabbed hold of my damned hood. I knocked her right off her feet like the harlot she is and she hit her pretty little head on a table. Now her blood is on my hands and Mother wants revenge. I ran as fast as I could out of there. I am not dying for some debauched little waif.]]></entry>	
    <entry id="journal_page_text_73"><![CDATA[It has been weeks, maybe even months. I lost track ever since the first hunting parties found me. That crazed hag never forgets a grudge. “A life for a life.” Nothing but deranged drivel from that witch. I never believed in her preachings, I was just in it for my own gain. Now she’s sending more and more thugs to take my head. I am better than all of them. I’ve racked up a kill count that should be feared, and it only grows with each perilous encounter.]]></entry>	
    <entry id="journal_page_text_74"><![CDATA[This is tiring. That psychotic harpy continues to send more and more of her kin to hunt me down. I cannot live like this, in constant peril of the next ambush. It is time that I find a place to hide. Maybe life as a mercenary for a noble family will suffice. Best that those pompous fools die instead me when the time comes, after all...]]></entry>

They have us all tied up, ready for whatever cruel fate they wish to inflict on us. They are slavers. I have heard of what happened to the neighboring clans, and we have become their next victims. I pray that we will be rescued soon, I cannot imagine what will become of me in this hellish place.]]></entry>

The women that have not been sold off are here with me, rotting away and wishing for death. The birds surround us, eager to feast on our broken bodies, but I feel a connection. They ask for a sacrifice in exchange for freedom. They want to know that I am willing to give. The others yell and kick them away, but I allow them to approach me. They ask for my arm’s flesh, and in exchange they will loosen my bonds. I accept.]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_77"><![CDATA[(The page is dirty and hardly legible) Released of my bonds, I did not free the others. They refused the gifts of the flock and do not deserve the blessings I was bestowed. I carved a path of bodies as I made my way to the leader of this slavers’ group, the first of many offerings I will make to my new found family. When I finally found their leader, I did not hesitate to gouge his eyes out and leave him as one final offering for the first feast of my flock.]]></entry>	
    <entry id="journal_page_text_78"><![CDATA[(The page is dirty and hardly legible) As for those left, I gave them a simple choice. Stay and become part of our flock, or deny us and become our offering. Many refused, and were made examples of. For those who stayed, I made it clear what we stood for. The cycle of life and death is all that matters. A life for a life is the cost for transgression. Every death is an offering, and so long as that one rule is kept, I will respect their way of life. We are shepherds for the weak, and those deemed unworthy will become an offering to our flock.]]></entry>

Please refrain from reading any further and return this item to its rightful owner. You may find me using the map provided. Thank you. Signed, Euryale (Attached is a detailed map of the Hamlet.

    <entry id="journal_page_text_30"><![CDATA[(The journal entry is written in a very fine and elegant cursive) It's been quite some time since I've stepped foot in this grand city. Much has changed in my absence. The miserly workers had been replaced with cheerful men and women talking of the most recent battles in the king's arena. They also talk of a valiant champion who will be fighting in the arena later in the day. I tried to brush off the chatter but as I wandered about, all I heard was more and more of this man's heroic feats. With my interest peaked, I'll be making my way to the gladiatorial ring soon.]]></entry>

    <entry id="journal_page_text_31"><![CDATA[(The journal entry is written in a very fine and elegant cursive) Typical. I took a wrong turn on my way to the arena and ended up in a rather droll part of the city which served as a home to many vulgar and unscrupulous individuals. It was only predictable that I would be stopped by a group of these thugs looking to strip me of my belongings. A rather poor choice of words and hands that touched places they shouldn't have resulted in an unpleasant series of events that took up more of my time than I had hoped. The praised hero would begin his fight soon so I hastily picked up my mirror and made my way to the coliseum.]]></entry>

    <entry id="journal_page_text_32"><![CDATA[(The journal entry is written in a very fine and elegant cursive) I just barely made it in time for the battle. Luckily one of the guards was kind enough to procure me a seat where I could best spectate the skirmish. As the gates opened, a single man emerged and I sat amongst the crowd in awe.]]></entry>

    <entry id="journal_page_text_33"><![CDATA[(The journal entry is written in a very fine and elegant cursive) The audience cheered in excitement. The warrior was the physical embodiment of perfection. His chiseled body told of a man who had seen rigorous battles while his long flowing hair would have many believe he was born from the gods. In one hand he held a fisherman's net and in the other an ornate trident. He was so perfect that I had reason to believe he had attained his beauty through obscure means, just as I had.]]></entry>

    <entry id="journal_page_text_34"><![CDATA[(The journal entry is written in a very fine and elegant cursive) Amongst the crowd's cheering admiration, the hero's adversary appeared. On the opposite side of the arena, a rusted gate opened and what emerged was a behemoth pulled in chains by beastmasters. It was a creature from a children's tale. A hulking monster covered in iron spikes and decorated with scars. The citizens greeted this thing with mocking shouts and vulgar insults. Despite this menacing beast, the champion did not show an ounce of fear, but instead smirked with confidence.]]></entry>

    <entry id="journal_page_text_35"><![CDATA[(The journal entry is written in a very fine and elegant cursive) The beastmasters released their chains and the battle began. At first I had my doubts. The monster was the size of ten men and shook the earth with every step. How could any man possibly hope to defeat such a thing? But to my surprise, the hero was succeeding. The fight looked more like a dance, with the agile warrior dodging the ogre's clumsy strikes. He stabbed at it with masterful precision and weaved around the behemoth as it mindlessly swung its boulder fists around in frustration.]]></entry>

    <entry id="journal_page_text_36"><![CDATA[(The journal entry is written in a very fine and elegant cursive) In a spectacular display, the champion thrusted his trident into the heart of the beast, causing blood to spill forth and sending the crowd into a raucous frenzy. With a loud thud, the creature collapsed and its defiling blood soaked the soil around it. The crowd continued to cheer and applaud as the hero took in their admiration. He bravely walked to the massive corpse and planted one foot on top of its metallic head. He waved to the crowd and I could have sworn he had turned to me and winked. My heart skipped a beat.]]></entry>

    <entry id="journal_page_text_37"><![CDATA[(The journal entry is written in a very fine and elegant cursive) It all happened so quickly. Our admiration quickly turned to horror as the beast revealed that it was still alive. The creature caught the hero's leg in an iron grip. It pulled the man to the ground and, with its other fist, it slammed down on the champion's face. A single scream was all we heard as the behemoth smashed the man's head and splattered bits of him all around. It slowly stood back up, covered in the gore of its victim. A moment of shock soon shifted to panic and anguish as the torn crowd began to demand justice.]]></entry>

    <entry id="journal_page_text_38"><![CDATA[(The journal entry is written in a very fine and elegant cursive) The crowd entered a vengeful frenzy as they shouted for the guards. I quickly took my leave and the last thing I saw was the beast running rampant on the beastmasters that tried to subdue it. Even as I hastily made my way out of the amphitheater's gates, I could still hear the frantic shouts of the crowd and the trembling of the earth itself. It had been interesting returning to my city of origin, but I sense a riot will soon break out and I plan to depart long before it has any effect on me.]]></entry>

    <entry id="journal_page_text_40"><![CDATA[길을 떠난 지 얼마 되지도 않았는데 벌써부터 느낌이 좋지 않다. 한 시간도 지나지 않아 신입이 불평을 한다. 너무 흙이 많고 너무 많이 걸었단다. 최악인 건 원정을 나서는 그녀의 복장이 치렁치렁한 로브인데다가, 웬 깨진 거울을 들고 다닌다는 거다. 대체 왜 그런 이상한 걸 들고 다닐까? 그녀는 그게 “편하다고” 한다. 도시 사람들은 참 이해할 수가 없다니까...]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_41"><![CDATA[첫 싸움부터 아주 제대로 틀어질 뻔했지만, 신입은 어찌저찌 해난 것 같다. 이제 보니 그 깨진 거울로 치유 마법을 쓰는 마녀인 것 같다. 튜리드가 이교도에게 제대로 찔렸을 때 금방 회복시켜 주었다. 알드윈은 그녀가 맘에 드는 것 같지만, 뭔가가 좀 의심스럽다...]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_42"><![CDATA[모든 게 잘 돼 간다. 지금은 모닥불 옆에서 이걸 쓰고 있다. 우리 마녀님은 튜리드와 서로 칭찬하기 바쁘다. 뭐가 좋다고 그러는지는 모르겠지만. 그녀가 도시에서 곱게 자란 여자치고도 상당히 예쁜 건 인정해야겠다. 피부는 한 점 흠이 없고 목소리도 아름답다. 그녀가 들고 다니는 그 망할 거울이 문제다. 깨지고 긁힌 흔적이 수두룩해서 그녀보다 나이가 많을 것 같다. 희한하기도 하지...]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_43"><![CDATA[밤에 산적놈들이 우리를 급습했다. 내가 몸담았던 패거리와는 다르지만 행동거지는 다를 게 하나도 없었다. 불쌍한 알드윈이 첫 번째 희생양이었다. 산적 한 놈이 제대로 찔러서 배를 갈라 버렸고, 그는 피를 쏟으며 쓰러졌다. 내가 활을 잡기도 전에 사수 한 놈이 내 팔을 맞혔다. 팔이 망가졌으니 난 아무것도 할 수 없었다. 놈들은 곧장 마녀에게로 향했다. 가엾게도 그녀는 막 깨어난 참이었다. 그게 마지막이 될 줄 알았지만, 내 완전한 착각이었다...]]></entry>

    <entry id="journal_page_text_53"><![CDATA[이 대도시까지 사냥감을 쫓아오는 길이다. 이번 목표는 정말 은밀하다. 행동을 보면 직접 맞서기보다 뒤에서 교묘하게 조종하는 것을 선호하는 걸 알 수 있다. 이 퇴폐적인 도시 사람들 속에서 마녀를 찾아내는 것부터도 쉬운 일은 아니겠지만, 추적을 포기하지 않을 것이다. 빛이 나를 인도하신다.]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_54"><![CDATA[마녀를 찾아냈다. 생각했던 것만큼 영리하지는 않았다. 교만한 천성과 불쾌한 자기과시 덕분에 쉽게도 찾을 수 있었다. 도시민들 모두에게 마녀의 타락을 널리 알렸다. 곧 사냥을 시작한다.]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_55"><![CDATA[마녀는 도시 변두리 빈민가로 몸을 피했다. 그런 괴물이 활보하게 내버려 둘 수는 없다. 그래서 나는 그 타락한 주거지 전체를 불태워 버렸다. 도망칠 곳이 없으니 마녀도 불길 속에서 죄값을 치르게 될 것이다.]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_56"><![CDATA[불길이 가라앉았다. 재 속에서 많은 수의 불타 버린 시체가 발견되었다. 신원을 알아볼 수는 없지만, 마녀가 그 중에 있는 건 분명하다. 내 극단적인 행동에도 불구하고, 도시민들은 불길에 타 죽은 사람들에게는 별로 관심을 갖지 않는 것 같다. 분명 악을 몰아내는 데 있어서 이 소시민들의 희생은 아주 작은 것이라는 데에 나와 뜻을 같이하고 있을 것이다. 이렇게 또 하나의 괴물을 영원히 처단했다. 타락에 맞서는 나의 성전은 멈추지 않을 것이다.]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_57"><![CDATA[이제 내 이름은 빛의 영웅으로 남을 것이다! 드디어 우리의 믿음을 갈라 놓으려 했던 이단자 마녀를 생포했다. 내가 직접 처형을 집행할 것이다. 이런 거짓 예언자에게 가장 합당한 처벌은 신성한 불꽃으로 태워 없애는 것이다.]]></entry>

    <entry id="journal_page_text_61"><![CDATA[우리의 계획은 시작되었다. 이제 우리는 가장 약한 왕국이라는 신세를 벗어날 것이다. 서쪽의 바다 괴물들과 북쪽의 전쟁광들도 우리를 두려워할 것이다. 모두가 우리가 이 땅의 정당한 주인임을 알게 되리라. 우리와 같은 완벽한 존재들이 모두를 지배하는 것은 당연한 운명이다.]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_62"><![CDATA[가장 의외의 장소에서 아름다움을 찾아냈다. 농노들이 사는 시골을 여행하던 도중, 두 명의 완벽한 꽃 같은 이들과 마주쳤다. 보기 드문 아름다움과 우아함을 갖추고, 마치 서로 거울에 비춘 것 같은 이들이었다. 하층민들의 더러움 속에 그런 보석들을 버려 둘 수는 없었기에, 우리가 그녀들을 거둬들였다. 그들이 이 계획의 가장 중요한 부분을 맡을 것이다.]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_63"><![CDATA[그들은 금방 적응했다. 마치 타고난 전설들 같다. 한 명은 전쟁을, 다른 한 명은 외교를 수련하는 쌍둥이 꽃. 그들의 기술은 흠결 하나 없이 완벽하고, 곧 사도들이 그녀들을 따라하는 것을 보게 될 것이다. 우리의 군대는 날로 늘어간다. 이 완벽의 화신들과 함께라면, 몇 년 안으로 우리 전사들은 완벽해질 것이다.]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_64"><![CDATA[몇 달의 철저한 훈련 끝에 결과가 나타나고 있다. 쌍둥이 꽃의 지휘 아래 우리의 군사들은 신의 사도들이 되어 간다. 여전사는 그녀처럼 완벽한 살갗을 가진 청년들만을 까다롭게 골라 엄히 가르친다. 그녀는 자신의 기술에는 그와 어울리는 완벽한 미가 필요하다 말한다. 우리는 완전한 존재의 가르침을 이해할 수 없기에 그녀를 의심하지 않는다. 많은 군사들이 강도 높은 훈련을 버티지 못하고 쓰러졌지만, 견뎌내고 살아남은 자들은 초월하여 우리의 적들을 정복할 것이다.]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_65"><![CDATA[몇십 년이 걸린 계획이 드디어 결실을 맺는다! 쌍둥이 꽃의 첫 출사는 우아함 그 자체였다. 북쪽 왕국은 우리의 공격을 버티지 못했다. 여전사는 아름다운 것만큼이나 우아했다. 전장을 춤추듯 누비며 적의 피로 흙을 적시는 그녀의 뒤를 우리의 완벽한 전사들이 따랐다. 우리 군은 오늘 승리했고, 앞으로 수많은 승리가 기다릴 것이다. 적들은 비로소 우리를 두려워할 것이며, 곧 우리 앞에 머리를 조아릴 것이다. 모두 축제를 준비한다. 오늘 밤은 영원히 기억되리라.]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_66"><![CDATA[끔찍한 비극이 찾아왔다. 꽃 한 송이가 꺾여 버렸다. 우리의 가장 뛰어난 전사들의 시체에 둘러싸인 채 피를 흘리며 죽어 있었다. 다른 꽃은 어디에서도 찾을 수 없었다. 악의에 찬 저주들이 사방에 쓰여 있었다. 저 증오스러운 적들의 마술이 분명하다. 우리를 직접 칠 수 없다는 것을 알았기에 사람들을 잠입시켜 우리가 가장 취약할 때를 노린 것이다. 이건 끝이 아니다. 우리는 잃어버린 꽃을 찾아내어 군대를 재건할 것이다.]]></entry>

    <entry id="journal_page_text_67"><![CDATA[망할. 여자 한 명이 도망쳐 버렸다. 애스콧이 매듭을 잘못 묶어서 그 처자는 이제 숲 속 어딘가에 있을 거다. 바보 같으니. 어머님께선 자렛, 메이비스와 나를 시켜서 그녀를 쫓으라고 하셨다. 멍청한 놈 하나 때문에 오늘 하루도 망쳤다. 돌아오면 가르침을 주는 의미로 칼침이라도 한 방 놓아 버릴까.]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_68"><![CDATA[여자는 찾았지만, 자렛과 메이비스가 사냥의 흥분을 이기지 못하고 그녀를 죽여 버렸다. 난 짜증이 치밀어올라서 즉시 어머님께로 돌아가 보고했다. 그분도 대노하셨다. 자렛과 메이비스가 돌아오자 우리 모두를 불러 모으시고는 일벌백계를 하셨다. "목숨 값은 목숨으로 갚아라." 항상 하시던 말씀이다. 둘은 죽을 때까지 서로 싸워야 했다. 결국에는 둘 다 죽었다. 자렛은 내장이 사방에 뿌려졌고 메이비스는 머리통이 부서졌다. 끔찍하긴 하지만, 이걸로 얼간이들 두 놈은 더 이상 안 봐도 된다.]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_69"><![CDATA[어머님이 내게 또 사냥을 시키셨다. 이번에는 동방 출신의 "이국적인" 여자가 목표다. 이곳을 곧 지나간다고 하니, 그녀를 추적하는 것이 내 임무다. 쓸모없는 애스콧 놈도 날 따라오고는 있지만, 짐 덩어리일 뿐이다. 뭐, 최소한 좋은 총알받이는 될 거다.]]></entry>	
    <entry id="journal_page_text_70"><![CDATA[여자를 잡았지만 대가도 컸다. 망할 호위병들이 생전 처음 보는 기술을 써서 애를 좀 먹었다. 우리가 기습당했지만, 머릿수로 밀어붙였다. 애스콧이 습격을 당해 죽었다. 그거 하나는 다행이다. 망할 여자는 말도 통하지 않는다. 그저 이상한 외국 언어로 지껄이고만 있다. 뺨을 몇 대 때려서 조용히 시켜야 했다. 어머님이 무슨 생각을 하고 계시든, 그럴 만한 가치가 있는 여자였으면 좋겠다. 난 이런 일을 하루에 몰아 하는 걸 좋아하지도 않고, 내 기분만 점점 상하고 있다.]]></entry>	
    <entry id="journal_page_text_71"><![CDATA[여자를 어머님께 데려갔다. 그분은 이 처자를 찾고 있었던 사람들을 만나 보라고 하셨다. 귀족 몇 명이었다. 우두머리로 보이는 자가 먼 외국의 사치품들을 "뒤늦게" 좋아하게 되어서, 우리가 원하는 모든 음식, 무기, 갑옷, 뭐든지 풍족하게 제공하겠다고 한다. 이 연약한 여자 한 명 값으로 말이다. 내가 가서 거래를 감독하기로 했다.]]></entry>	
    <entry id="journal_page_text_72"><![CDATA[마소보다 못한 망할 창녀 같으니. 그년이 갑자기 내 후드를 잡아챘다. 매춘부 다루듯이 곧장 넘어뜨렸더니 머리를 식탁에 세게 부딪혀 버렸다. 피를 보았으니 어머님이 가만히 있으실 리 없다. 최대한 빨리 도망쳤다. 음란한 년 하나 때문에 죽을 생각은 없다.]]></entry>	
    <entry id="journal_page_text_73"><![CDATA[몇 주, 몇 달이 되었는지 모르겠다. 처음 추격 조를 만난 이후로 시간 감각을 잃어버렸다. 그 정신 나간 마녀는 원한을 절대 잊지 않는다. "목숨 값은 목숨으로 갚아." 그 입에서는 미친 소리밖에 안 나올 거다. 그렇게 떠들어대는 설교를 믿은 적은 없었다. 그저 내 몫을 챙기려고 가담하고 있었을 뿐이다. 이제 마녀는 내 목을 따려고 산적들을 점점 더 많이 보내고 있다. 그래도 내 상대는 못 된다. 어디 가서 살해 기록이라도 보여 주면 모두가 무서워할 거다. 그리고 그건 놈들과 위험천만한 싸움을 할 때마다 늘어만 가고 있다.]]></entry>	
    <entry id="journal_page_text_74"><![CDATA[정말 지친다. 날 죽이려고 그 사이코가 보내는 부하들의 숫자가 늘어만 간다. 이렇게 언제 올지 모르는 습격에 전전긍긍하면서 살 수는 없다. 어딘가 몸을 숨길 곳을 찾아야 한다. 귀족 집안의 용병 일이면 괜찮을지도 모른다. 혹시 그자들이 나 대신에 죽어 줄지도 모르는 일이니까...]]></entry>

    <entry id="journal_page_text_75"><![CDATA[(페이지는 더럽고 글씨는 겨우 알아볼 수 있다) 남자들은 모두 죽었다. 내 남편, 오빠, 내 아이까지도. 우리는 모두 묶여서 잔인한 운명을 기다리는 처지가 되었다. 저자들은 노예 상인들이다. 이웃 일족이 어떻게 되었는지 들은 적이 있다. 우리가 다음 희생자가 된 것이다. 빨리 구출되기를 바란다. 이 지옥 같은 곳에서 내가 무슨 일을 겪을지는 상상할 수도 없다.]]></entry>	
    <entry id="journal_page_text_76"><![CDATA[(페이지는 더럽고 글씨는 겨우 알아볼 수 있다) 우리는 소보다도 못한 취급을 받고 있다. 흙을 먹으며 더러워진 채 버려져 있다. 팔려나가지 않은 여자들은 이곳에서 나와 썩어가며 죽음을 바라고 있다. 우리의 망가진 몸뚱이를 먹어치우려는 새들이 우리를 둘러싸고 있다. 하지만 그들과 나를 이어 주는 무언가가 느껴진다. 그들은 희생을 대가로 자유를 주겠다고 한다. 내게 그럴 의지가 있는지 알고 싶어 한다. 다른 이들은 비명을 지르며 새들을 차내지만, 나는 그들을 가까이 불러들인다. 내 팔을 주면 이 속박을 풀어 주겠다고 한다. 나는 받아들였다.]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_77"><![CDATA[(페이지는 더럽고 글씨는 겨우 알아볼 수 있다) 속박에서 풀렸지만 다른 이들을 자유롭게 해 주지는 않았다. 그들은 무리가 주는 선물을 거부했고, 내가 받은 축복을 받을 자격이 없다. 그들의 시체를 넘어 이 노예 상인들의 우두머리에게로 다가갔다. 내 새로운 가족에게 바칠 첫 제물이 될 것이다. 우두머리를 보자마자 놈의 눈알을 뽑아내고 내 무리의 만찬을 위한 제물로 바쳤다.]]></entry>	
    <entry id="journal_page_text_78"><![CDATA[(페이지는 더럽고 글씨는 겨우 알아볼 수 있다) 남은 자들에게는 선택권을 주었다. 남아서 무리의 일부가 되거나, 거절하고 제물이 되거나. 많은 자들이 거부했고 곧 같은 운명을 맞았다. 남은 이들에게는 단 하나의 목표를 심어 주었다. 삶과 죽음의 순환만이 모든 것이다. 초월의 대가는 삶을 위해 목숨을 바치는 것이다. 모든 죽음은 곧 제물이고, 그것만 지킨다면 그들의 삶을 존중할 것이다. 우리는 약한 자들을 이끄는 목동이다. 자격 없는 자들은 무리의 제물이 될 것이다.]]></entry>

    <entry id="journal_page_text_29"><![CDATA[(The journal entry is written in a very fine and elegant cursive) To whomever may be the reader. This is a private journal. Please refrain from reading any further and return this item to its rightful owner. You may find me using the map provided. Thank you. Signed, Euryale (Attached is a detailed map of the Hamlet. However, the directions given have been smudged and are unreadable)]]></entry>

    <entry id="journal_page_text_30"><![CDATA[(The journal entry is written in a very fine and elegant cursive) It's been quite some time since I've stepped foot in this grand city. Much has changed in my absence. The miserly workers had been replaced with cheerful men and women talking of the most recent battles in the king's arena. They also talk of a valiant champion who will be fighting in the arena later in the day. I tried to brush off the chatter but as I wandered about, all I heard was more and more of this man's heroic feats. With my interest peaked, I'll be making my way to the gladiatorial ring soon.]]></entry>

    <entry id="journal_page_text_31"><![CDATA[(The journal entry is written in a very fine and elegant cursive) Typical. I took a wrong turn on my way to the arena and ended up in a rather droll part of the city which served as a home to many vulgar and unscrupulous individuals. It was only predictable that I would be stopped by a group of these thugs looking to strip me of my belongings. A rather poor choice of words and hands that touched places they shouldn't have resulted in an unpleasant series of events that took up more of my time than I had hoped. The praised hero would begin his fight soon so I hastily picked up my mirror and made my way to the coliseum.]]></entry>

    <entry id="journal_page_text_32"><![CDATA[(The journal entry is written in a very fine and elegant cursive) I just barely made it in time for the battle. Luckily one of the guards was kind enough to procure me a seat where I could best spectate the skirmish. As the gates opened, a single man emerged and I sat amongst the crowd in awe.]]></entry>

    <entry id="journal_page_text_33"><![CDATA[(The journal entry is written in a very fine and elegant cursive) The audience cheered in excitement. The warrior was the physical embodiment of perfection. His chiseled body told of a man who had seen rigorous battles while his long flowing hair would have many believe he was born from the gods. In one hand he held a fisherman's net and in the other an ornate trident. He was so perfect that I had reason to believe he had attained his beauty through obscure means, just as I had.]]></entry>

    <entry id="journal_page_text_34"><![CDATA[(The journal entry is written in a very fine and elegant cursive) Amongst the crowd's cheering admiration, the hero's adversary appeared. On the opposite side of the arena, a rusted gate opened and what emerged was a behemoth pulled in chains by beastmasters. It was a creature from a children's tale. A hulking monster covered in iron spikes and decorated with scars. The citizens greeted this thing with mocking shouts and vulgar insults. Despite this menacing beast, the champion did not show an ounce of fear, but instead smirked with confidence.]]></entry>

    <entry id="journal_page_text_35"><![CDATA[(The journal entry is written in a very fine and elegant cursive) The beastmasters released their chains and the battle began. At first I had my doubts. The monster was the size of ten men and shook the earth with every step. How could any man possibly hope to defeat such a thing? But to my surprise, the hero was succeeding. The fight looked more like a dance, with the agile warrior dodging the ogre's clumsy strikes. He stabbed at it with masterful precision and weaved around the behemoth as it mindlessly swung its boulder fists around in frustration.]]></entry>

    <entry id="journal_page_text_36"><![CDATA[(The journal entry is written in a very fine and elegant cursive) In a spectacular display, the champion thrusted his trident into the heart of the beast, causing blood to spill forth and sending the crowd into a raucous frenzy. With a loud thud, the creature collapsed and its defiling blood soaked the soil around it. The crowd continued to cheer and applaud as the hero took in their admiration. He bravely walked to the massive corpse and planted one foot on top of its metallic head. He waved to the crowd and I could have sworn he had turned to me and winked. My heart skipped a beat.]]></entry>

    <entry id="journal_page_text_37"><![CDATA[(The journal entry is written in a very fine and elegant cursive) It all happened so quickly. Our admiration quickly turned to horror as the beast revealed that it was still alive. The creature caught the hero's leg in an iron grip. It pulled the man to the ground and, with its other fist, it slammed down on the champion's face. A single scream was all we heard as the behemoth smashed the man's head and splattered bits of him all around. It slowly stood back up, covered in the gore of its victim. A moment of shock soon shifted to panic and anguish as the torn crowd began to demand justice.]]></entry>

    <entry id="journal_page_text_38"><![CDATA[(The journal entry is written in a very fine and elegant cursive) The crowd entered a vengeful frenzy as they shouted for the guards. I quickly took my leave and the last thing I saw was the beast running rampant on the beastmasters that tried to subdue it. Even as I hastily made my way out of the amphitheater's gates, I could still hear the frantic shouts of the crowd and the trembling of the earth itself. It had been interesting returning to my city of origin, but I sense a riot will soon break out and I plan to depart long before it has any effect on me.]]></entry>

    <entry id="journal_page_text_40"><![CDATA[길을 떠난 지 얼마 되지도 않았는데 벌써부터 느낌이 좋지 않다. 한 시간도 지나지 않아 신입이 불평을 한다. 너무 흙이 많고 너무 많이 걸었단다. 최악인 건 원정을 나서는 그녀의 복장이 치렁치렁한 로브인데다가, 웬 깨진 거울을 들고 다닌다는 거다. 대체 왜 그런 이상한 걸 들고 다닐까? 그녀는 그게 “편하다고” 한다. 도시 사람들은 참 이해할 수가 없다니까...]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_41"><![CDATA[첫 싸움부터 아주 제대로 틀어질 뻔했지만, 신입은 어찌저찌 해난 것 같다. 이제 보니 그 깨진 거울로 치유 마법을 쓰는 마녀인 것 같다. 튜리드가 이교도에게 제대로 찔렸을 때 금방 회복시켜 주었다. 알드윈은 그녀가 맘에 드는 것 같지만, 뭔가가 좀 의심스럽다...]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_42"><![CDATA[모든 게 잘 돼 간다. 지금은 모닥불 옆에서 이걸 쓰고 있다. 우리 마녀님은 튜리드와 서로 칭찬하기 바쁘다. 뭐가 좋다고 그러는지는 모르겠지만. 그녀가 도시에서 곱게 자란 여자치고도 상당히 예쁜 건 인정해야겠다. 피부는 한 점 흠이 없고 목소리도 아름답다. 그녀가 들고 다니는 그 망할 거울이 문제다. 깨지고 긁힌 흔적이 수두룩해서 그녀보다 나이가 많을 것 같다. 희한하기도 하지...]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_43"><![CDATA[밤에 산적놈들이 우리를 급습했다. 내가 몸담았던 패거리와는 다르지만 행동거지는 다를 게 하나도 없었다. 불쌍한 알드윈이 첫 번째 희생양이었다. 산적 한 놈이 제대로 찔러서 배를 갈라 버렸고, 그는 피를 쏟으며 쓰러졌다. 내가 활을 잡기도 전에 사수 한 놈이 내 팔을 맞혔다. 팔이 망가졌으니 난 아무것도 할 수 없었다. 놈들은 곧장 마녀에게로 향했다. 가엾게도 그녀는 막 깨어난 참이었다. 그게 마지막이 될 줄 알았지만, 내 완전한 착각이었다...]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_44"><![CDATA[마녀가 그 거울을 떨어뜨리자 흉측한 본모습이 드러났다. 촉수가 흐느적대고, 아가리에서 침이 흐르며, 괴물은 산적들을 보고 울부짖었다. 튜리드는 그 모습만 보고도 비명을 지르며 도망쳤다. 산적 살인마 한 놈이 칼을 휘두르자, 괴물은 엄청난 속도로 움직이며 수많은 입에서 역겨운 담즙을 뱉어냈다. 그 바보들은 살과 뼈가 타들어가는 고통에 몸부림치며 비명을 질렀다. 이내 끓고 있는 피 웅덩이 말고는 아무것도 남지 않았다. 그 광경을 보자마자 산적단 모두가 도망갔고, 그 순간 괴물이 내게로 시선을 돌렸다. 난 본능적으로 최대한 빨리 어둠 속으로 도망쳤다...]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_45"><![CDATA[상처가 곪았다. 헛것이 보인다. 망할 새 자식도 그 난리통에 날아가 버리고 돌아오지 않는다. 아마 튜리드도 알드윈과 같은 꼴이 됐을 거다. 그 말도 못할 괴물의 기억에 사로잡힌 채 나무 밑에 웅크리고 앉아서 최후를 맞는다니. 언젠가는 내 죄를 용서받을 줄 알았지만, 이제 다른 수많은 이들처럼 잊힌 채 죽는 것밖에 남지 않았다. 내가 이 공포와 맞서 싸울 수 있다고 줄곧 생각했는데, 너무 늦게 깨달았다...]]></entry>

    <entry id="journal_page_text_53"><![CDATA[이 대도시까지 사냥감을 쫓아오는 길이다. 이번 목표는 정말 은밀하다. 행동을 보면 직접 맞서기보다 뒤에서 교묘하게 조종하는 것을 선호하는 걸 알 수 있다. 이 퇴폐적인 도시 사람들 속에서 마녀를 찾아내는 것부터도 쉬운 일은 아니겠지만, 추적을 포기하지 않을 것이다. 빛이 나를 인도하신다.]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_54"><![CDATA[마녀를 찾아냈다. 생각했던 것만큼 영리하지는 않았다. 교만한 천성과 불쾌한 자기과시 덕분에 쉽게도 찾을 수 있었다. 도시민들 모두에게 마녀의 타락을 널리 알렸다. 곧 사냥을 시작한다.]]></entry>

"목숨 값은 목숨으로 갚아라." 항상 하시던 말씀이다. 둘은 죽을 때까지 서로 싸워야 했다. 결국에는 둘 다 죽었다. 자렛은 내장이 사방에 뿌려졌고 메이비스는 머리통이 부서졌다. 끔찍하긴 하지만, 이걸로 얼간이들 두 놈은 더 이상 안 봐도 된다.]]></entry>

Please refrain from reading any further and return this item to its rightful owner. You may find me using the map provided. Thank you. Signed, Euryale (Attached is a detailed map of the Hamlet.

    <entry id="journal_page_text_30"><![CDATA[(The journal entry is written in a very fine and elegant cursive) It's been quite some time since I've stepped foot in this grand city. Much has changed in my absence. The miserly workers had been replaced with cheerful men and women talking of the most recent battles in the king's arena. They also talk of a valiant champion who will be fighting in the arena later in the day. I tried to brush off the chatter but as I wandered about, all I heard was more and more of this man's heroic feats. With my interest peaked, I'll be making my way to the gladiatorial ring soon.]]></entry>

    <entry id="journal_page_text_31"><![CDATA[(The journal entry is written in a very fine and elegant cursive) Typical. I took a wrong turn on my way to the arena and ended up in a rather droll part of the city which served as a home to many vulgar and unscrupulous individuals. It was only predictable that I would be stopped by a group of these thugs looking to strip me of my belongings. A rather poor choice of words and hands that touched places they shouldn't have resulted in an unpleasant series of events that took up more of my time than I had hoped. The praised hero would begin his fight soon so I hastily picked up my mirror and made my way to the coliseum.]]></entry>

    <entry id="journal_page_text_32"><![CDATA[(The journal entry is written in a very fine and elegant cursive) I just barely made it in time for the battle. Luckily one of the guards was kind enough to procure me a seat where I could best spectate the skirmish. As the gates opened, a single man emerged and I sat amongst the crowd in awe.]]></entry>

    <entry id="journal_page_text_33"><![CDATA[(The journal entry is written in a very fine and elegant cursive) The audience cheered in excitement. The warrior was the physical embodiment of perfection. His chiseled body told of a man who had seen rigorous battles while his long flowing hair would have many believe he was born from the gods. In one hand he held a fisherman's net and in the other an ornate trident. He was so perfect that I had reason to believe he had attained his beauty through obscure means, just as I had.]]></entry>

    <entry id="journal_page_text_34"><![CDATA[(The journal entry is written in a very fine and elegant cursive) Amongst the crowd's cheering admiration, the hero's adversary appeared. On the opposite side of the arena, a rusted gate opened and what emerged was a behemoth pulled in chains by beastmasters. It was a creature from a children's tale. A hulking monster covered in iron spikes and decorated with scars. The citizens greeted this thing with mocking shouts and vulgar insults. Despite this menacing beast, the champion did not show an ounce of fear, but instead smirked with confidence.]]></entry>

    <entry id="journal_page_text_35"><![CDATA[(The journal entry is written in a very fine and elegant cursive) The beastmasters released their chains and the battle began. At first I had my doubts. The monster was the size of ten men and shook the earth with every step. How could any man possibly hope to defeat such a thing? But to my surprise, the hero was succeeding. The fight looked more like a dance, with the agile warrior dodging the ogre's clumsy strikes. He stabbed at it with masterful precision and weaved around the behemoth as it mindlessly swung its boulder fists around in frustration.]]></entry>

    <entry id="journal_page_text_36"><![CDATA[(The journal entry is written in a very fine and elegant cursive) In a spectacular display, the champion thrusted his trident into the heart of the beast, causing blood to spill forth and sending the crowd into a raucous frenzy. With a loud thud, the creature collapsed and its defiling blood soaked the soil around it. The crowd continued to cheer and applaud as the hero took in their admiration. He bravely walked to the massive corpse and planted one foot on top of its metallic head. He waved to the crowd and I could have sworn he had turned to me and winked. My heart skipped a beat.]]></entry>

    <entry id="journal_page_text_37"><![CDATA[(The journal entry is written in a very fine and elegant cursive) It all happened so quickly. Our admiration quickly turned to horror as the beast revealed that it was still alive. The creature caught the hero's leg in an iron grip. It pulled the man to the ground and, with its other fist, it slammed down on the champion's face. A single scream was all we heard as the behemoth smashed the man's head and splattered bits of him all around. It slowly stood back up, covered in the gore of its victim. A moment of shock soon shifted to panic and anguish as the torn crowd began to demand justice.]]></entry>

    <entry id="journal_page_text_38"><![CDATA[(The journal entry is written in a very fine and elegant cursive) The crowd entered a vengeful frenzy as they shouted for the guards. I quickly took my leave and the last thing I saw was the beast running rampant on the beastmasters that tried to subdue it. Even as I hastily made my way out of the amphitheater's gates, I could still hear the frantic shouts of the crowd and the trembling of the earth itself. It had been interesting returning to my city of origin, but I sense a riot will soon break out and I plan to depart long before it has any effect on me.]]></entry>

We have been tasked with exploring a portion of the wealds, a place that brings back many unpleasant memories but one that I know better than anyone. I will be accompanied by Turid and Aldwin.

She says its "comfortable". I'll never understand these city-folk...]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_41"><![CDATA[Our first encounter in this wretched place almost ended in disaster, but the recruit pulled through. Turns out she's some witch, using her broke mirror to conjure some healing magic. Made Turid right as rain when he got stabbed by some cultist. Aldwin has taken a liking to her, but I've grown suspicious...]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_42"><![CDATA[Everything is going smoothly. I sit and write this as we rest by the campfire. The witch lady is trading compliments with Turid, some rubbish I'll never understand. Have to admit, even for a damsel raised in the cities, she is extraordinarily beautiful. Flawless skin with a soothing voice. The only thing wrong is that damn mirror of hers. Shattered and scratched up like its older than her. Very strange...]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_43"><![CDATA[Damn brigands ambushed us in the night. Different lot than the one I used to run with but their behaviour was no different. Poor Aldwin was the first victim, one of the brutes stabbed him right in the gut and sliced him open. He died laying in a pool of his own blood. Before I could even grab my bow, one of their rangers blasted my arm. Completely mangled, I'll be no use to anyone in this state. They went straight for the witch, poor thing had just woken up. I thought that'd be the end for her but I couldn't be more wrong...]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_44"><![CDATA[The damned witch dropped her mirror to reveal her hideous form. A mess of tentacle, maw, and spit, screeching at her would-be assailants. Turid ran screaming just from the sight of the thing. When one of the cutthroats took a swing at the creature, it moved with impossible speed and vomited a putrid bile from its many mouthes. The poor fools screamed in agony as their flesh melted from their bones until all that remained was a puddle of boiling blood. That alone was enough to send the whole band of thugs running, and in that moment the monstrosity turned its gaze to me. Pure instinct kicked in and I ran as fast as I could into the darkness...]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_45"><![CDATA[The wound is infected. I'm having hallucinations. My damned bird flew away during that terrible encounter and hasn't returned. I can only assume Turid has suffered the same fate as Aldwin. To think this is the way it would end, huddled under a tree haunted by the memories of that unspeakable creature. I thought I'd be redeemed for my sins, but instead I die forgotten like so many other countless souls. I thought I was ready to fight the horrors, but now I know better...]]></entry>

    <entry id="journal_page_text_53"><![CDATA[I tracked my latest hunt to the grand city. This one will be illusive, its behaviour suggests that it prefers manipulation over direct confrontation. It'll be difficult to identify the creature, given the degeneracy of this city's populace, but I will not give up my search. The Light guides me.]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_54"><![CDATA[I've found the hag. I over-estimated its intelligence, it had made itself easy to find based on its arrogant nature and abhorrent flaunting. I've announced its debaucheries to the entirety of the city populace and the hunt will soon begin.]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_55"><![CDATA[The creature fled into the foul shantytowns that sit in the city's shadow. I cannot allow such a thing to exist, so I set the entirety of the corrupted dwellings ablaze. With nowhere to run, it will surely burn for its sins.]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_56"><![CDATA[Many charred corpses were found amongst the aftermath. They are unrecognizable but I am sure that the witch can be included among them. Despite my radical actions, the cityfolk do not seem to care for those lost in the fire. Surely they must understand as I do that the loss of these peasants is a small price to pay for the eradication of evil. And so, with another monster put down for good, I continue my crusade against corruption.]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_57"><![CDATA[This will surely mark me down in the manuscripts as a hero of the Light! We have captured the heretical witch that had splintered our faith. I will be responsible for her execution, and there is no punishment more fitting for a false prophet than death by holy fire.]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_58"><![CDATA[To see the witch with my own eyes is to know pure corruption. There is no doubt that this thing is responsible for splitting the faithful followers of the Light into conflicted factions. It speaks as if it is a disciple of the Light like us, but I see through her ruse. I will commence the burning shortly.]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_59"><![CDATA[It is an abomination unlike any I've encountered! It extinguished the sanctioned fires of the pyre with ease and presented itself as an avatar of the Flame. It had converted all around me to its falsified fate and I watched in horror as both peasants and crusaders of the Light bowed in unison to this creature of debased prophecies. I retreated from its deformed presence, and now I must warn those that are still pure of its corrupting nature.]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_60"><![CDATA[The worst thing has come to reality. The creature proved too strong, and now all have come to worship it as a demigod. I have been excommunicated from what was once a faith that fought the darkness but now is a cult praising a thing that mockingly resembles an angel. Even in the face of defeat, I will not stop my hunt. This thing must die, or mankind will be damned for eternity.]]></entry>

    <entry id="journal_page_text_61"><![CDATA[Our plan is in motion. No longer will we be the weakest of the kingdoms. The sea fiends of the west and the warmongers of the north will fear us. They will know that we are the rightful rulers of this land. We are perfect beings, so it is our destiny to rule over all.]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_62"><![CDATA[Beauty can be found in the most unlikely of places. On our travels through the peasant countryside, we stumbled upon two perfect flowers. Mirror copies of each other, with unnatural beauty and poise. It is not right to leave something so precious in the filth of the common people, so we took them in. They will be a quintessential piece to our plan.]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_63"><![CDATA[They took quickly to our ways. They are a legend born in flesh. The Twin Flowers, one that trains in war, another that trains in diplomacy. Their technique is flawless, perfected, and we are eager to see disciples follow their ways. Our army forms quickly. Within years, we will have an army of perfect warriors, trained by the dual embodiment of perfection.]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_64"><![CDATA[It has been months of rigorous training, but we are beginning to see results. The Twin Flowers are training our mortal soldiers into godly disciples. The Warrior is a strict, selective, only training young men with skin as flawless as hers. She says that her technique must be matched with unearthly beauty. We do not doubt her, for we cannot begin to comprehend the lessons of a perfect being. Many soldiers have fallen from the intense training, but we know that those that survive and persevere will ascend, and vanquish our foes.]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_65"><![CDATA[This plan was decades in the making, and finally the fruits of our labor can be harvested! The Twin Flowers’ first performance was grandeur. The north kingdom could not withstand our assault. The Warrior was as graceful as she is beautiful. Dancing across the battlefield, painting the dirt with our foes’ blood as our perfect soldiers followed in her path. Our flawless army triumphed this day and they will triumph for many more. Our enemies will finally know fear, and they will bow to us in time. We prepare for celebration, tonight will be a night remembered forever.]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_66"><![CDATA[A terrible tragedy has befell us. The Twin Flowers are no more. One was found, surrounded by the corpses of our finest warriors, naked and splayed out in a pool of her own blood. The other Flower was nowhere to be found. Spiteful maledictions were posted all around the room, surely some sorcery by our most hated enemy. They knew they couldn’t fight us directly, so they sent infiltrators to kill us when we were most vulnerable. This will not be our end. We will find the lost flower, and we will rebuild our army. ]]></entry>

    <entry id="journal_page_text_67"><![CDATA[Damn it, one of the damsels escaped. Ascot must have tied the knots wrong and now the wench is out in the woods, that idiot. Mother is sending me with Jarret and Mavis to track her down. It is unsurprising, really. My day ruined by the actions of a brain dead oaf. Maybe I’ll stab him in the sack to teach him a lesson once I return.]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_68"><![CDATA[We found the maiden, but Jarret and Mavis got carried away with the hunt and killed the girl. Irritating. I returned to Mother immediately to tell her. She was furious. She gathered up the lot of us after Jarret and Mavis returned to make an example of them. “A life for a life”, she always says. Had the two of them fight to the death. They ended up killing each other. Jarret had his guts splayed out while Mavis got his skull crushed. Gruesome scene, but that’s two more jackasses I won’t have to deal with.]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_69"><![CDATA[I am being sent by Mother on another hunt. This time we’re taking us one of those “exotic” women from the east. They’re passing through here soon and I am in charge of tracking this one. That useless cockroach Ascot is coming along. He is only dead weight to me. He will be good fodder at the very least.]]></entry>	
    <entry id="journal_page_text_70"><![CDATA[We got the girl, but at heavy cost. The damn guards used some foreign fighting technique, nothing I’ve ever seen before. Caught us off guard but we outnumbered them. Ascot died in the ambush, only good thing to come of this. The damn wench doesn’t even speak sense, talking in some foreign tongue. Had to slap some quiet into her. This one better be worth whatever Mother is getting. This is more work than I prefer in a single day, and it is putting me in a worse mood.]]></entry>	
    <entry id="journal_page_text_71"><![CDATA[We brought her back to Mother, and she sent us to meet up with the lot that asked for this foreign sheep in the first place. A bunch of nobles they are. The head of them has an “acquired” taste for imported goods and is offering us bountiful amounts of food, weapons, armor, whatever we want, for this fragile thing. I will be there to oversee the trade. ]]></entry>	
    <entry id="journal_page_text_72"><![CDATA[That contemptible whorish excuse for human cattle. That slit-eyed profligate grabbed hold of my damned hood. I knocked her right off her feet like the harlot she is and she hit her pretty little head on a table. Now her blood is on my hands and Mother wants revenge. I ran as fast as I could out of there. I am not dying for some debauched little waif.]]></entry>	
    <entry id="journal_page_text_73"><![CDATA[It has been weeks, maybe even months. I lost track ever since the first hunting parties found me. That crazed hag never forgets a grudge. “A life for a life.” Nothing but deranged drivel from that witch. I never believed in her preachings, I was just in it for my own gain. Now she’s sending more and more thugs to take my head. I am better than all of them. I’ve racked up a kill count that should be feared, and it only grows with each perilous encounter.]]></entry>	
    <entry id="journal_page_text_74"><![CDATA[This is tiring. That psychotic harpy continues to send more and more of her kin to hunt me down. I cannot live like this, in constant peril of the next ambush. It is time that I find a place to hide. Maybe life as a mercenary for a noble family will suffice. Best that those pompous fools die instead me when the time comes, after all...]]></entry>

    <entry id="journal_page_text_75"><![CDATA[(The page is dirty and hardly eligible) They slaughtered all the men. My husband, my brother, even my own son. They have us all tied up, ready for whatever cruel fate they wish to inflict on us. They are slavers. I have heard of what happened to the neighboring clans, and we have become their next victims. I pray that we will be rescued soon, I cannot imagine what will become of me in this hellish place.]]></entry>	
    <entry id="journal_page_text_76"><![CDATA[(The page is dirty and hardly eligible) They treat us worse than cattle. We are given dirt to eat and left soiled. The women that have not been sold off are here with me, rotting away and wishing for death. The birds surround us, eager to feast on our broken bodies, but I feel a connection. They ask for a sacrifice in exchange for freedom. They want to know that I am willing to give. The others yell and kick them away, but I allow them to approach me. They ask for my arm’s flesh, and in exchange they will loosen my bonds. I accept.]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_77"><![CDATA[(The page is dirty and hardly eligible) Released of my bonds, I did not free the others. They refused the gifts of the flock and do not deserve the blessings I was bestowed. I carved a path of bodies as I made my way to the leader of this slavers’ group, the first of many offerings I will make to my new found family. When I finally found their leader, I did not hesitate to gouge his eyes out and leave him as one final offering for the first feast of my flock.]]></entry>	
    <entry id="journal_page_text_78"><![CDATA[(The page is dirty and hardly eligible) As for those left, I gave them a simple choice. Stay and become part of our flock, or deny us and become our offering. Many refused, and were made examples of. For those who stayed, I made it clear what we stood for. The cycle of life and death is all that matters. A life for a life is the cost for transgression. Every death is an offering, and so long as that one rule is kept, I will respect their way of life. We are shepherds for the weak, and those deemed unworthy will become an offering to our flock.]]></entry>

    <entry id="journal_page_text_24"><![CDATA[如此美丽之物必属于宫殿，他们说。所以他们绑起了我的手，将我与金像与珠宝挂饰一起锁在货车中。我和这些货物一样，是稀世珍宝中的凤毛麟角，是总督宝库中的一员。我听说过这个暴君的可怕名声，所以我惶惶不可终日。]]></entry>

    <entry id="journal_page_text_29"><![CDATA[（日记条目是以一种非常精细优雅的练笔字体书写的）无论读者是谁。这是一本私人日记。请不要继续阅读，并将此物品归还给其合法所有者。您可以使用提供的地图找到我。谢谢你。署名，欧律阿勒（附件是小镇的详细地图。然而，给出的位置被弄脏了，无法阅读）]]></entry>

    <entry id="journal_page_text_30"><![CDATA[（日记条目是以一种非常精细优雅的练笔字体书写的）我已经很久没有踏进这座宏伟的城市了。在我不在的时候发生了很多变化。吝啬的工人们被愉快的男女们所取代，他们谈论着国王竞技场最近的战斗。他们还谈到了一位勇敢的冠军，他将在当天晚些时候在竞技场上战斗。我试图摆脱喋喋不休的谈话，但当我四处闲逛时，我听到的只是越来越多关于这个人的英勇事迹。随着我的兴趣达到顶峰，我就踏上了前往环形角斗场的道路。]]></entry>

    <entry id="journal_page_text_31"><![CDATA[（日记条目是以一种非常精细优雅的练笔字体书写的）经典桥段。我在去竞技场的路上拐错了弯，然后来到了这座城市的一个相当滑稽的地方，那里是众多粗俗无耻的人的家。可以预见的是，我会被那些暴徒中的一群拦住，他们想夺走我的财物。用词的选择和用手触碰了不该触碰地方——我不知道这两个哪个更糟，导致了一系列令人不快的事件，占用了我比我所期望的更多时间。这位饱受赞誉的英雄很快就要开始战斗了，所以我赶紧拿起镜子，向运动场地走去。]]></entry>

    <entry id="journal_page_text_32"><![CDATA[（日记条目是以一种非常精细优雅的练笔字体书写的）我也只是勉强赶上战斗。幸运的是，其中一名警卫好心地给我找了一个座位，让我能最好地观看这场冲突。当大门打开时，一个人出现了，而我惊诧地坐在人群中。]]></entry>

    <entry id="journal_page_text_33"><![CDATA[（日记条目是以一种非常精细优雅的练笔字体书写的）观众兴奋地欢呼起来。战士就是完美这个词的物理化身。他轮廓分明的身躯诉说着一个经历过艰苦战斗的人，而他飘逸的长发让许多人相信他是众神所诞下的。他一手拿着渔民用的网，另一手拿着华丽的三叉戟。他是如此完美，以至于我有理由相信他和我一样，是通过不可名状的方式获得了自己的美貌。]]></entry>

    <entry id="journal_page_text_34"><![CDATA[（日记条目是以一种非常精细优雅的练笔字体书写的）在人群欢呼的赞美声中，英雄的对手出现了。在竞技场的另一边，一扇生锈的大门打开了，出现了一个被兽王用铁链拉着的庞然大物。这是一个来自儿童故事中的生物。一个覆盖着铁钉和疤痕的巨大怪物。市民们用嘲笑的叫喊和粗俗的侮辱来迎接这东西。尽管这是一头凶猛的野兽，冠军并没有表现出丝毫的恐惧，而是自信地笑了。]]></entry>

    <entry id="journal_page_text_35"><![CDATA[（日记条目是以一种非常精细优雅的练笔字体书写的）兽王们松开了锁链，战斗开始了。起初我有点怀疑。这个怪物有十个人那么大，每走一步都会撼动大地。任何人怎么可能有希望打败这样的东西？但令我惊讶的是，英雄成功了。战斗看起来更像一场舞蹈，敏捷的战士躲开了食人魔笨拙的攻击。他以娴熟的精准刺向它，绕着这只庞然大物盘旋，它在沮丧中无脑地挥舞着巨石般的拳头。]]></entry>

    <entry id="journal_page_text_36"><![CDATA[（日记条目是以一种非常精细优雅的练笔字体书写的）在一次壮观的表演中，冠军将他的三叉戟刺进了野兽的心脏，导致鲜血四溅，观众陷入了喧嚣的狂喜中。随着一声巨响，这个生物倒下了，它沾污的血液浸透了周围的土壤。当英雄接受他们的敬佩时，人群继续欢呼和鼓掌。他勇敢地走向那具巨大的尸体，将一只脚放在它的金属脑袋上。他向人群挥手，我可以发誓他转头看向我并眨了眨眼。我的心停跳了一拍。]]></entry>

    <entry id="journal_page_text_37"><![CDATA[（日记条目是以一种非常精细优雅的练笔字体书写的）这一切发生得太快了。当这头野兽表现出它还活着的迹象时，我们的钦佩很快变成了恐惧。这个生物紧紧抓住了英雄的腿。它把男人拽到地上，用另一只拳头猛击在冠军的脸上。我们只听到一声尖叫，庞然大物砸碎了这名男子的头，并将把的尸块溅得到处都是。它慢慢地站起来，身上沾满了受害者的碎肉。震惊的瞬间很快转变为惊慌，而如被撕裂般的观众们开始要求声张正义。]]></entry>

    <entry id="journal_page_text_38"><![CDATA[（日记条目是以一种非常精细优雅的练笔字体书写的）人群在对卫兵吼叫中陷入了复仇的狂乱。我很快就离开了，而我看到的最后一件事是那只野兽在试图制服它的兽王面前疯狂逃窜。即使我匆忙走出竞技场的大门，我仍能听到人群疯狂的叫喊声和大地本身的颤抖声。回到我降生的城市很有趣，但我感觉骚乱很快就会爆发，我计划在骚乱对我产生任何影响的很久之前就离开。]]></entry>

    <entry id="journal_page_text_40"><![CDATA[我们已经开始了我们的任务，我已经有了不好的预感。离离开不到一个小时，新鲜血液已经在抱怨了。她说步行太多，污物太多。最糟糕的是，她穿着华丽的长袍，挥舞着一面破碎的镜子来到探险的队伍里。她为什么要带这么奇怪的装备？她说它“很舒适”。我永远都不会理解这些城里人…………]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_41"><![CDATA[我们在这个不幸的地方的第一次遭遇战几乎以灾难告终，但新兵挺了过来。原来她是个女巫，用她破碎的镜子召唤出一些治疗魔法。让图里德被某个邪教徒刺伤只会也能变得如沐春风。奥尔德温开始喜欢她，但我滋生出了怀疑……]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_42"><![CDATA[一切进展顺利。我们在营火旁休息时，我坐下来并写下了这篇日记。巫婆在和图里德互相拍马屁，说一些我永远不会理解的垃圾话。不得不承认，即使对于一个在城市长大的少女来说，她也异常美丽。无瑕肌肤，声音舒缓。唯一的问题是她那该死的镜子。破碎而又不满划痕，仿佛那镜子比她还要古老。很奇怪……]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_43"><![CDATA[该死的土匪在夜里伏击了我们。各方各面和我以前一起共事的人相差很多，但他们的行为却没有什么不同。可怜的奥尔德温是第一个受害者，其中的一个野蛮人把刀刺进了他的肚子，将他刨开。他躺在自己的血泊中死去。我还没来得及拿弓，他们的一个拿远程武器的就轰了我的胳膊。彻底残废，我在这个状态下对任何人都没有用。他们直奔女巫，可怜的家伙才刚刚醒来。我以为这会是她的结局，但我错了……]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_44"><![CDATA[那个该死的女巫放下镜子，露出了她丑陋的形态。一堆触手、口器和口水，向她潜在的攻击者发出刺耳的尖叫。图里德一看到那东西就尖叫着逃跑了。当其中一个割喉者向这只生物挥刀时，它以不可能的速度移动，并从它的众多口器里吐出了一种腐臭的胆汁。可怜的傻瓜们痛苦地尖叫着，他们的肉在骨头上融化了，剩下的只有一滩沸腾的血液。光是这一点就足以让一帮暴徒逃跑，就在那一刻，怪物把目光转向了我。纯粹的本能开始发作，我尽可能快地跑进黑暗中……]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_45"><![CDATA[伤口感染了。我出现了幻觉。我那该死的鸟在那场可怕的遭遇中飞走了，一直没有回来。我只能假设图里德和奥尔德温遭遇了同样的命运。想到这就是结局，蜷缩在一棵树下，被那个难以形容的生物的记忆所困扰。我以为我会为自己的罪孽赎罪，但我却像其他无数灵魂一样被人遗忘。我以为我已经准备好与恐怖之物作斗争，但现在我更加知晓……]]></entry>

    <entry id="journal_page_text_53"><![CDATA[我追踪着最近一个在大城市内的猎物。这一次将充满幻象，它的行为表明它更喜欢暗箱操作而不是直接对抗。鉴于这座城市人口的堕落，很难辨别出这个生物，但我不会放弃我的搜索。圣光指引着我。]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_54"><![CDATA[我找到了巫婆。我高估了它的智慧，因为它傲慢的天性和令人憎恶的夸耀，很容易就会被发现。我已经向全市人民宣布了它的放荡行为，狩猎很快就要开始了。]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_55"><![CDATA[这个生物逃到城市阴影下肮脏的棚户区。我不能允许这样的事情存在，所以我点燃了整个腐败的住宅。在无处可逃的情况下，它肯定会因自己的罪恶而燃烧。]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_56"><![CDATA[在残余中发现了许多烧焦的尸骸。他们无法辨认，但我相信女巫也可能在他们之间。尽管我采取了激进的行动，但城市居民似乎并不关心那些在火灾中丧生的人。他们当然必是像我一样理解，失去这些草包对于根除邪恶来说只是一个很小的代价。因此，随着另一个怪物被永远放倒，我继续我对抗腐化的圣战。]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_57"><![CDATA[这肯定会让我在手稿中成为圣光的英雄！我们抓获了分裂我们信仰的异端女巫。我要负责处决她，对于一个伪先知来说，没有什么惩罚比用圣火处死更合适的了。]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_58"><![CDATA[我一用我的眼睛看见女巫就知道这是纯粹的腐化之物。毫无疑问，这件事是导致圣光忠实的信徒分裂成互相冲突的派别的原因。它说话的样子好像是和我们一样的圣光门徒，但我看穿了她的诡计。我很快就会开始燃烧。]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_59"><![CDATA[它是个和我接触过的任何东西的都有所不同的憎恶之物！它轻而易举地扑灭了木柴，并以圣炎的化身显现。它把我周围的一切都变成了它的虚伪天命，我惊恐地看着草包和圣光十字军战士齐声向这个堕落预言的生物屈尊。我在它扭曲的存在中退缩，现在我必须警告那些仍然纯洁的人，它的腐化本质。]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_60"><![CDATA[最糟糕的事情已经变为现实。这个生物被证明太过强大，现在所有人都把它当作一位半神来崇拜。我被逐出了曾经与黑暗作斗争，但现在是一个赞美嘲弄天使之物的邪教的信仰。即使面对失败，我也不会停止我的狩猎。这东西必须死，否则人类将永远被诅咒。]]></entry>

    <entry id="journal_page_text_62"><![CDATA[美可以在最不可能的地方被找到。在我们穿越乡村的旅途中，我们偶然发现了两朵完美的花。彼此皆为互相的镜像，具有不自然的美丽和沉稳。把如此珍贵的东西留在贱民的污物中是不对的，所以我们把它们收走了。它们将是我们计划的一个精华部分。]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_63"><![CDATA[他们很快就步上了我们的路。她们是一个有血有肉的传说。双子之花，一朵在战争中受训，另一朵在外交中受训。他们的技术完美无瑕，我们渴望看到弟子们遵循他们的方式。我们的军队组建得很快。几年内，我们将拥有一支由完美战士组成的军队，借由完美的二重身训练。]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_64"><![CDATA[经过几个月的严格训练，我们开始看到成效。双子之花正在把我们的凡人士兵训练成虔诚的门徒。战士是恪守军纪、精心挑选而出的，只训练皮肤像她一样无暇的年轻人。她说她的技艺必须与超凡脱俗的美相匹配。我们不怀疑她，因为我们是无法开始理解完美存在的教诲的。许多士兵在激烈的训练中倒下，但我们知道，那些幸存下来并坚持下去的人将飞升，并击败我们的敌人。]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_65"><![CDATA[这个计划酝酿了几十年，终于收获到了我们的劳动成果！双子之花的第一次表现非常壮观。北国无法经受我们的进攻。战士既优雅又美丽。在战场上翩翩起舞，用敌人的鲜血在泥土上作画，我们完美的士兵跟随在她的道路上。我们完美无缺的军队今天取得了胜利，他们将取得更多的胜利。我们的敌人最终会知晓恐惧，他们会及时向我们屈尊。我们准备庆祝，今晚将是一个永生难忘的夜晚。]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_66"><![CDATA[一场可怕的悲剧降临在我们身上。这对双子之花已经不复存在了。其中一位找到了，被我们最优秀的战士的尸体包围着，赤裸着躺在她自己的血泊中。另一朵花哪儿也找不到。房间里贴满了是恶毒的咒符，肯定是我们最讨厌的敌人的巫术。他们知道他们不能直接和我们对抗，所以他们派遣了渗透者在我们最脆弱的时候杀死我们。这不会是我们的结局。我们将找到丢失的花朵，重建我们的军队。]]></entry>

    <entry id="journal_page_text_67"><![CDATA[该死，其中一个少女逃走了。阿斯科特一定哪根经搭错了，而现在那丫头在树林里，那个白痴。鹰母派我和杰瑞特与梅维斯一起去追踪她。这并不奇怪，真的。我的一天被一个脑残的白痴毁了。也许我回来后会捅他一刀来教训他。]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_68"><![CDATA[我们找到了少女，但杰瑞特和梅维斯走远去狩猎并杀死了女孩。真是气人。我立即回到鹰母那里禀告她。她非常愤怒。杰瑞特和梅维斯回来后，她聚集了我们很众人，为他们树立了榜样。“一命换一命”，她总是这么说。命令他们俩战斗到死。他们最终同归于尽。杰瑞特的内脏撒了一地，而马维斯的头骨被粉碎了。可怕的场景，但这是两个不需要我处理的蠢货。]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_69"><![CDATA[我被鹰母派去进行另一次狩猎。这一次我们要抢走其中一个来自东方的“异国”女人。她们很快就会经过这里，我负责跟踪这个女的。那个没用的蟑螂阿斯科特来了。他对我来说只不过是个累赘。他至少会是个好诱饵。]]></entry>	
    <entry id="journal_page_text_70"><![CDATA[我们抓到了了那个女孩，但代价很高。该死的警卫使用了一些异国的战斗技巧，没有一招是我以前见过的。这让我们措手不及，但我们在人数上碾压了他们。阿斯科特死于伏击，这是唯一的好消息。那该死的丫头连话都说不通，说话用的都是外语。必须让她安静下来。这一个最好是值得的，无论鹰母能得到什么。这一天的工作量比我能接受的要要多，这让我心情更糟了。]]></entry>	
    <entry id="journal_page_text_71"><![CDATA[我们把她带回了鹰母身边，她让我们去他们最先在要这只异国羔羊的那群人。他们是一群贵族。他们的头目对异国商品有一种“后天形成”的品味，并为我们提供大量的食物、武器、盔甲——无论我们想要什么，来换取这个脆弱的东西。我将在那里监督交易。]]></entry>	
    <entry id="journal_page_text_72"><![CDATA[人口贸易的那个借口淫荡又卑鄙。那个眼睛狭长的败家女抓住了我该死的兜帽。我像打妓女一样把她打得栽倒下去，她漂亮的小脑袋撞到了桌角上。现在她的血在我手上，而鹰母想要复仇。我尽可能快地跑了出去。我才不会为一个放荡的小妇人而死。]]></entry>	
    <entry id="journal_page_text_73"><![CDATA[已经好几个星期，甚至几个月了。自从第一次狩猎队找到我后，我就失去了踪迹。那个疯狂的巫婆一直都很记仇。“一明换一命”只不过是那个女巫的胡言乱语。我从不相信她的说教，我只为我自己的利益。现在她派越来越多的暴徒来取我的头。我比他们都要枪。我已经记出了一个应该令人害怕的杀敌数，而且它只会随着每次危险的遭遇而增加。]]></entry>	
    <entry id="journal_page_text_74"><![CDATA[这太累了。那个精神错乱的鸟妖继续派越来越多她的同族来追捕我。我不能这样生活，不断处于下一次伏击的危险中。我该找个地方躲起来了。也许贵族家族的佣兵生活就够了。最好的话会是那些自命不凡的傻瓜在时机到来时替我去死，毕竟……]]></entry>

    <entry id="journal_page_text_75"><![CDATA[（书页肮脏并且几乎看不清）他们屠杀了所有的人。我的丈夫，我的兄弟，甚至我自己的儿子。他们把我们都绑起来，准备好面对他们想给我们带来的任何残酷命运。他们是奴隶主。我听说了邻近部落发生的事情，我们成了他们的下一个受害者。我祈祷我们能很快获救，我无法想象我在这个地狱般的地方会变成什么样子。]]></entry>	
    <entry id="journal_page_text_76"><![CDATA[（书页肮脏并且几乎看不清）他们对待我们比对待牲畜还糟。我们吃的是土，浑身肮脏。那些没有被卖出去的女人和我关在一起，腐烂殆尽并渴望死亡。鸟儿们围着我们，渴望享用我们残破的尸体，但我感觉到了一种联系。他们要求牺牲以换取自由。他们想知道我是否愿意付出。其他人大喊大叫并把他们赶走，但我允许他们靠近我。他们要我的手臂上的肉，作为交换，他们会给我松绑。我接受。]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_77"><![CDATA[（书页肮脏并且几乎看不清）我被解绑了，而我没有释放其他人。他们拒绝了鹰群的礼物，并且不配得到我所获得的祝福。当我走向这群奴隶主团体的首领时，我杀出了一条遍布尸骸的道路，这是我将向我新成立的家族献出的许多祭品中的第一件。当我终于找到他们的首领时，我毫不犹豫地挖出他的眼睛，把他作为我的鹰群的第一次盛宴的最后一个祭品。]]></entry>	
    <entry id="journal_page_text_78"><![CDATA[（书页肮脏并且几乎看不清） 至于剩下的人，我给了他们一个简单的选择。留下来，成为我们鹰群的一部分，或者拒绝我们，成为我们的祭品。许多人拒绝了，并成为了反例。对于那些留下来的人，我表明了我们的立场。生命和死亡的循环才是最重要的。一命换一命便是违反规矩的代价。每一次死亡都是一次供奉，只要遵守这一条规则，我就会尊重他们的生活方式。我们是弱者的牧羊人，那些被认为毫无价值的人将成为我们鹰群的祭品。]]></entry>

Então me fazem dançar diante de seus rostos desesperados e empoeirados, de seus olhos úmidos e vermelhos, seus lábios rachados e sorridentes. Não sou uma pessoa para esses espectadores depravados, mas uma maravilha exótica. Sou uma coisa bela.]]></entry>

A serpente surge silenciosamente detrás de uma pedra, sua língua provando o ar. A mordida é rápida, mas o veneno é lento.

    <entry id="journal_page_text_30"><![CDATA[(O diário inteiro está escrito em uma cursiva muito fina e elegante) Já faz algum tempo desde que pisei na grande cidade. Muita coisa mudou na minha ausência. Os trabalhadores miseráveis haviam sido substituídos por homens e mulheres alegres falando sobre as mais recentes batalhas na arena do rei. Eles também falam de um valente campeão que estará lutando na arena ao final do dia. Tentei entender a conversa, mas enquanto andava por aí, tudo o que ouvia era sobre os feitos heróicos desse homem. Como atingiu meu interesse, irei a caminho do anel de gladiadores em breve.]]></entry>

    <entry id="journal_page_text_31"><![CDATA[(O diário inteiro está escrito em uma cursiva muito fina e elegante) Típico. Tomei o caminho errado para a arena e acabei em uma parte muito esquisita da cidade, que servia de lar a muitas pessoas vulgares e sem escrúpulos. Era previsível que logo seria abordada por esse grupo de bandidos que tentariam desviar-me de meu destino. Uma escolha bem fraca de palavras e mãos que tocaram lugares que não deveriam, resultando em uma série desagradável de eventos que levou mais tempo do que eu esperava. O herói louvado começaria sua luta em breve, então peguei rapidamente meu espelho e me dirigi ao coliseu.]]></entry>

    <entry id="journal_page_text_32"><![CDATA[(O diário inteiro está escrito em uma cursiva muito fina e elegante) Quase não chego a tempo para a batalha. Por sorte, um dos guardas foi gentil o suficiente para me arrumar um assento onde eu poderia ver melhor a escaramuça.  medida que os portes abriam, um único homem emergiu e sentei-me entre a multidão com admiração.]]></entry>

    <entry id="journal_page_text_33"><![CDATA[(O diário inteiro está escrito em uma cursiva muito fina e elegante) O público aplaudiu de excitação. O guerreiro era a encarnação física da perfeição. Seu corpo cinzelado contou um homem que tinha visto batalhas rigorosas, enquanto seus longos cabelos flutuavam muitos acreditavam que ele nascera dos deuses. Em uma mão, ele segurava uma rede de pescadores e, na outra, um tridente ornamentado. Era tão perfeito que eu tinha motivos para acreditar que ele tinha alcançado sua beleza através de meios obscuros, exatamente como eu fiz.]]></entry>

    <entry id="journal_page_text_34"><![CDATA[(O diário inteiro está escrito em uma cursiva muito fina e elegante) Entre admiração e aplausos da multidão, o adversário do herói apareceu. No lado oposto da arena, um portão enferrujado se abriu e o que surgiu era um mosntro, um gigante puxado por correntes pelos carcereiros. Era uma criatura dos contos infantis. Um monstro grotesco coberto por espinhos de ferro e decorado com cicatrizes. Os cidadãos cumprimentaram aquela coisa com vaias e insultos vulgares. Apesar da besta ameaçadora, o campeão não mostrou sequer ter medo, mas sorriu com confiança.]]></entry>

    <entry id="journal_page_text_35"><![CDATA[(O diário inteiro está escrito em uma cursiva muito fina e elegante) Os carcereiros soltaram suas correntes e a batalha começou. No começo, tive minhas dúvidas. O monstro tinha o tamanho de dez homens e abalava a terra a cada passo. Como alguém poderia ter esperança de derrotar tal coisa? Mas para minha surpresa, o herói estava tendo sucesso. A luta parecia mais uma dança, com o ágil guerreiro esquivando os golpes desajeitados do ogro. Ele o esfaqueou com uma precisão magistral e rastejou-se ao redor da criatura, pois sem pensar balançou seus punhos de pedra em frustração.]]></entry>

    <entry id="journal_page_text_36"><![CDATA[(O diário inteiro está escrito em uma cursiva muito fina e elegante) Em uma exibição espetacular, o campeão empurrou seu tridente no coração da besta, fazendo com que o sangue fosse derramado e levando a multidão a um frenesi estridente. Com um baque alto, a criatura entrou em colapso e seu sangue contaminado encharcou o solo ao redor. A multidão continuou a torcer e aplaudir quando o herói assumiu sua admiração. Ele caminhou corajosamente até o cadáver maciço e plantou um pé em cima de sua cabeça metálica. Ele acenou para a multidão e eu poderia jurar que ele se virou para mim e piscou. Meu coração pulou.]]></entry>

    <entry id="journal_page_text_37"><![CDATA[(O diário inteiro está escrito em uma cursiva muito fina e elegante) Tudo aconteceu tão rapidamente. Nossa admiração rapidamente se transformou em horror quando a besta revelou ainda estar viva. A criatura pegou a perna do herói com um punho de ferro. Puxou o homem para o chão e, com o outro punho, bateu no rosto do campeão. Um único grito foi tudo o que ouvimos quando o monstro esmagou a cabeça do homem espalhando pedaços dela por toda parte. A criatura levantou-se lentamente, coberta pelo sangue de sua vítima. Um momento de choque logo virou pnico e angústia quando a multidão indignada começou a exigir justiça.]]></entry>

    <entry id="journal_page_text_38"><![CDATA[(O diário inteiro está escrito em uma cursiva muito fina e elegante) A multidão entrou em um frenesi vingativo enquanto gritavam para os guardas. Rapidamente me despedi e a última coisa que vi foi o animal correndo desenfreado com os carcereiros que tentaram subjugá-lo. Mesmo que eu apressadamente fizesse o caminho para os portes de saída do anfiteatro, ainda podia ouvir os gritos frenéticos da multidão e o tremor da própria terra. Foi interessante retornar a minha cidade de origem, mas percebo que uma revolta logo irá começar e planejo partir muito antes de ter algum efeito sobre mim.]]></entry>

We have been tasked with exploring a portion of the wealds, a place that brings back many unpleasant memories but one that I know better than anyone. I will be accompanied by Turid and Aldwin. While Turid can be brash sometimes and Aldwin reckless, they make for an effective and reliable crew. Also assigned to us is a new face, one that troubles me...]]></entry>

Turns out she's some witch, using her broke mirror to conjure some healing magic. Made Turid right as rain when he got stabbed by some cultist. Aldwin has taken a liking to her, but I've grown suspicious...]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_42"><![CDATA[Everything is going smoothly. I sit and write this as we rest by the campfire. The witch lady is trading compliments with Turid, some rubbish I'll never understand. Have to admit, even for a damsel raised in the cities, she is extraordinarily beautiful. Flawless skin with a soothing voice. The only thing wrong is that damn mirror of hers. Shattered and scratched up like its older than her. Very strange...]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_43"><![CDATA[Damn brigands ambushed us in the night. Different lot than the one I used to run with but their behaviour was no different. Poor Aldwin was the first victim, one of the brutes stabbed him right in the gut and sliced him open. He died laying in a pool of his own blood. Before I could even grab my bow, one of their rangers blasted my arm. Completely mangled, I'll be no use to anyone in this state. They went straight for the witch, poor thing had just woken up. I thought that'd be the end for her but I couldn't be more wrong...]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_44"><![CDATA[The damned witch dropped her mirror to reveal her hideous form. A mess of tentacle, maw, and spit, screeching at her would-be assailants. Turid ran screaming just from the sight of the thing. When one of the cutthroats took a swing at the creature, it moved with impossible speed and vomited a putrid bile from its many mouthes. The poor fools screamed in agony as their flesh melted from their bones until all that remained was a puddle of boiling blood. That alone was enough to send the whole band of thugs running, and in that moment the monstrosity turned its gaze to me. Pure instinct kicked in and I ran as fast as I could into the darkness...]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_45"><![CDATA[The wound is infected. I'm having hallucinations. My damned bird flew away during that terrible encounter and hasn't returned. I can only assume Turid has suffered the same fate as Aldwin. To think this is the way it would end, huddled under a tree haunted by the memories of that unspeakable creature. I thought I'd be redeemed for my sins, but instead I die forgotten like so many other countless souls. I thought I was ready to fight the horrors, but now I know better...]]></entry>

    <entry id="journal_page_text_53"><![CDATA[Segui minha última caça até a grande cidade. Esta presa será ilusória, seu comportamento sugere que prefira manipulação em confronto direto. Será difícil identificar a criatura, dada a degeneração da população desta cidade, mas não desistirei da minha pesquisa. A Luz me guia.]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_54"><![CDATA[Encontrei a bruxa. Superestimei sua inteligência, ela tornou-se fácil de encontrar com base em sua natureza arrogante e aborrecedora. Anunciei suas devastaçes para toda população da cidade e a caçada começará em breve.]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_55"><![CDATA[A criatura fugiu para os subúrbios que crescem nas sombras da cidade. Não posso permitir que tal coisa exista, então ateei fogo nas habitaçes corrompidas. Sem nenhum lugar para onde correr, certamente queimará por seus pecados.]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_56"><![CDATA[Muitos cadáveres foram encontrados entre os restos. São irreconhecíveis, mas estou certo de que a bruxa está entre eles. Apesar das minhas açes radicais, os habitantes da cidade parecem não se importar com aqueles que foram mortos pelas chamas. Certamente devem entender assim como eu que a perda desses camponeses é um preço pequeno a pagar pela erradicação do mal. E assim, com outro monstro derrubado para o bem, continuo minha cruzada contra a corrupção.]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_57"><![CDATA[Isso certamente me marcará nos manuscritos como um herói da Luz! Nós capturamos a bruxa herética que havia quebrado nossa fé. Serei responsável por sua execução, e não há punição mais apropriada para um falso profeta do que a morte pelo fogo sagrado.]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_58"><![CDATA[Vi a bruxa com os meus próprios olhos para conhecer a pura corrupção. Não há dúvida de que aquela coisa é responsável por dividir os seguidores fiéis da Luz em facçes conflitantes. Ela fala como se fosse um discípulo da Luz assim como nós, mas vejo através de sua artimanha. Vou começar a queimá-la logo.]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_59"><![CDATA[É uma abominação diferente das quais já encontrei! Extinguiu-se nas chamas sagradas da pira com facilidade e apresentou-se em um corpo de Fogo. Enfeitiçou todos ao meu redor com suas mentiras e assisti com horror, tanto os camponeses quanto os cruzados da Luz se curvaram perante esta criatura de profecias profanas. Retirei-me rapidamente de sua presença deformada, e agora devo avisar aqueles que ainda preservam a pureza da corrupção a espreita.]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_60"><![CDATA[O pior tornou-se realidade. A criatura mostrou-se muito forte, e agora todos vieram adorá-la como uma semideusa. Fui excomungado de uma fé que uma vez lutou contra a escuridão, mas agora é um culto que adora uma coisa que se parece com um anjo sátiro. Mesmo agora na derrota, não vou parar minha caçada. Aquela coisa deve morrer, ou a humanidade será condenada por toda eternidade.]]></entry>

    <entry id="journal_page_text_61"><![CDATA[Nosso plano está em movimento. Não seremos mais os mais fracos dos reinos. Os demônios do mar do oeste e os guerreiros do norte nos temerão. Eles saberão que somos os governantes legítimos desta terra. Nós somos seres perfeitos, então é nosso destino governar sobre todos.]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_62"><![CDATA[A beleza pode ser encontrada nos lugares mais improváveis. Em nossas viagens pelos campos do interior, nos deparamos com duas flores perfeitas. Espelhe cópias umas das outras, com beleza e equilíbrio antinatural. Não é certo deixar algo tão precioso na imundície das pessoas comuns, então nós as aceitamos. Elas serão uma peça essencial ao nosso plano.]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_63"><![CDATA[As levaram rapidamente aos nossos caminhos. Elas são lendas reencarnadas. As Flores Gêmeas, uma que treina na guerra, outra que treina na diplomacia. Sua técnica é impecável, aperfeiçoada e estamos ansiosos para ver os discípulos seguindo seus caminhos. Nosso exército se forma rapidamente. Dentro de anos, teremos um exército de guerreiros perfeitos, treinados pela dupla encarnação da perfeição.]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_64"><![CDATA[Foram meses de treinamento rigoroso, mas estamos começando a ver resultados. As Flores Gêmeas estão treinando nossos soldados mortais em discípulos piedosos. A Guerreira é uma jovem rigorosa, seletiva, treinando apenas jovens com uma pele tão perfeita quanto a dela. Ela diz que sua técnica deve ser combinada com a beleza sobrenatural. Não duvidamos dela, pois não podemos começar a compreender as lições de um ser perfeito. Muitos soldados caíram do treinamento intenso, mas sabemos que aqueles que sobreviverem e perseverarem ascenderão e vencerão nossos inimigos.]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_65"><![CDATA[Este plano foi feito há décadas e, finalmente, os frutos do nosso trabalho podem ser colhidos! A primeira execução das Flores Gêmeas foi grandiosa. O reino do norte não pôde suportar nosso ataque. A guerreira era tão graciosa quanto ela é bonita. Dançando através do campo de batalha, pintando o chão com o sangue de nossos inimigos enquanto nossos soldados perfeitos seguiam em seu caminho. Nosso exército impecável triunfou neste dia e eles vão triunfar muitos mais. Nossos inimigos finalmente conhecerão o medo e se curvarão a nós a tempo. Nós nos preparamos para a celebração, esta noite será uma noite a ser lembrada sempre.]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_66"><![CDATA[Uma terrível tragédia nos aconteceu. Não são mais As Flores Gêmeas. Uma delas foi encontrada, cercada pelos cadáveres de nossos melhores guerreiros, nua e largada em uma poça de seu próprio sangue. A outra Flor estava longe de ser encontrada. Rancorosas maldições foram postas por toda a sala, certamente alguma feitiçaria dos nossos piores inimigos. Eles sabiam que não poderiam nos combater diretamente, então enviaram infiltrados para nos matar quando estávamos mais vulneráveis. Este não será o nosso fim. Nós encontraremos a flor perdida e reconstruiremos nosso exército.]]></entry>

    <entry id="journal_page_text_67"><![CDATA[Porcaria, uma das donzelas escapou. Ascot deve ter errado um dos nós e agora a vadia fugiu para os bosques, esse idiota. Mamãe está me enviando com Jarret e Mavis para rastreá-la. Não é surpresa nenhuma, sério. Meu dia foi arruinado pelas ações de um sem noção imbecil. Talvez eu enfie uma faca no saco dele para ensiná-lo uma lição assim que eu voltar.]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_68"><![CDATA[Encontramos a vadia, só que Jarret e Mavis se empolgaram demais com a caçada e acabaram matando a garota. Irritante. Voltei para a mamãe imediatamente para contá-la. Ela tava furiosa, então reuniu a maioria de nós após os dois voltarem para fazer deles um exemplo. “uma vida por uma vida”, ela sempre dizia. Os dois tiveram que lutar até a morte, e acabaram se matando. Jarret teve sua tripas espalhadas para fora enquanto Mavis teve seu crânio esmigalhado. Foi uma cena aterrorizante, só que eram dois idiotas a menos pra lidar.]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_69"><![CDATA[Fui enviada pela mamãe em outra caçada. Dessa vez estamos apanhando uma dessas mulheres “exóticas” do leste. Elas estarão passando por aqui em breve e eu estou em cargo de rastrear essa aqui. Essa barata imprestável do Ascot está me acompanhando. Ele não passa de peso morto pra mim, mas será uma boa forragem no fim das contas.]]></entry>	
    <entry id="journal_page_text_70"><![CDATA[Nós pegamos a garota, mas pagamos caro. Os malditos guardas usaram umas técnicas de combate estrangeiras, nada que eu tenha visto antes. Nos pegaram com a guarda baixa, só que estávamos em maior número. Ascot morreu na emboscada, a única boa notícia dessa situação. A maldita vadia nem fala com sentido, usando uma língua desconhecida. tive que esbofetear ela até ficar quieta. É melhor essa aqui valer a pena, seja lá quanto a mamãe esteja levando. Isso foi mais trabalho do que eu gostaria de ter em um único dia e isso está me deixando de mau humor.]]></entry>	
    <entry id="journal_page_text_71"><![CDATA[Nós trouxemos a vadia de volta pra mamãe, e ela nos enviou para encontrarmos com o cliente que pediu por essa ovelha estrangeira pra começo de conversa. Era um grupo de nobres. O cabeça deles tinha “adquirido” gosto por bens importados e estava oferecendo uma generosa quantidade de comida, armas, armadura, tudo o que a gente quisesse por essa coisa frágil. Eu estarei lá para vigiar o acordo.]]></entry>	
    <entry id="journal_page_text_72"><![CDATA[Que desculpa desprezível para o gado humano. Aquela perdiz de olhos tortos se agarrou no meu maldito capuz. Eu a derrubei em seus pés como a prostituta que ela é e ela acertou sua linda pequena cabeça na mesa. Agora seu sangue estava em minhas mãos e mamãe quer vingança. Eu corri o mais rápido que pude pra fora dali. Eu não vou morrer por causa de uma criança abandonada e debochada.]]></entry>	
    <entry id="journal_page_text_73"><![CDATA[Já fazem semanas, talvez até meses. Eu perdi a noção do tempo desde que os primeiros grupos de caça me encontraram. Aquele bruxa lunática nunca se esquece de um rancor. “Uma vida por uma vida”. Nada além de uma besteira demente daquela megera. Eu nunca acreditei nos seus dogmas. Eu só estava lá pro meu próprio ganho pessoal. Agora ela está enviando mais e mais bandidos para apanhar minha cabeça. Eu sou melhor que todos eles. Eu já acumulei uma contagem de matanças que deveria ser temida, e que aumenta a cada encontro perigoso.]]></entry>	
    <entry id="journal_page_text_74"><![CDATA[Isso é um tédio. Aquela Harpia psicótica continua a enviar mais e mais de seus parentes para me caçar. Eu não posso viver assim, em constante perigo sobre a próxima emboscada. Está na hora de encontrar um lugar para me esconder. Talvez uma vida como mercenária para uma nobre família será suficiente. É melhor que aqueles tolos pomposos morram ao invés de mim quando a hora chegar, apesar de tudo...]]></entry>

Eles tem todas nós amarradas, prontas para qualquer destino cruel que desejem nos infligir. Eles são traficantes de escravos. Eu ouvi sobre o que aconteceu com os clãs vizinhos, e nós nos tornamos suas próximas vítimas. Eu rezo para que sejamos resgatadas em breve, porque não sei o que irei me tornar nesse lugar infernal.]]></entry>	
    <entry id="journal_page_text_76"><![CDATA[(A página está imunda e dificilmente legível) Eles nos tratam pior que gado. Nos dão sujeira pra comer e deixamos sujos. A mulher que não foi vendida está aqui comigo, apodrecendo e desejando a morte. Os pássaros nos cercaram ansiosos para  para se deliciarem com nossos corpos quebrados, mas sinto uma conexão. Eles pedem por um sacrifício em troca de liberdade. Eles querem saber o que estou disposta a dar. Os outros gritam e se chutam pra longe,  porém eu permito que eles se aproximem de mim. Eles pedem pela carne do meu braço, e em troca eles perderão meus laços. Eu aceito.]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_77"><![CDATA[(A página está imunda e dificilmente legível) Livre dos meus laços, eu não libertei as outras. Elas recusaram os presentes do rebanho e não merecem as bênçãos que me foram concedidas. Eu esculpi um caminho de cadáveres ao mesmo tempo que fazia meu caminho para o líder do grupo de escravos, as primeiras de muitas oferendas que farei para minha nova adquirida família. Quando finalmente encontrei o lider deles, eu não hesitei em arrancar seus olhos fora e deixá-lo como uma oferenda final para a minha primeira festa com meu rebanho.]]></entry>	
    <entry id="journal_page_text_78"><![CDATA[(A página está imunda e dificilmente legível) Para os restantes, dei uma escolha simples. Ficar e se tornarem parte do nosso rebanho ou nos recusar e se tornarem nossas oferendas. Muitos recusaram e foram feitos de exemplo. Para aqueles que ficaram, eu deixei bem claro o que nós pregamos. O ciclo de vida e morte é tudo o que importa. “Uma vida por uma vida” é o custo para uma transgressão. Toda morte é uma oferenda, e enquanto essa regra perdurar, eu respeitarei suas maneiras de viver. Nós somos pastores para os fracos, e aqueles que forem considerados indignos se tornarão uma oferta para nosso rebanho.]]></entry>

    <entry id="journal_page_text_29"><![CDATA[(The journal entry is written in a very fine and elegant cursive) To whomever may be the reader. This is a private journal. Please refrain from reading any further and return this item to its rightful owner. You may find me using the map provided. Thank you. Signed, Euryale (Attached is a detailed map of the Hamlet. However, the directions given have been smudged and are unreadable)]]></entry>

    <entry id="journal_page_text_30"><![CDATA[(The journal entry is written in a very fine and elegant cursive) It's been quite some time since I've stepped foot in this grand city. Much has changed in my absence. The miserly workers had been replaced with cheerful men and women talking of the most recent battles in the king's arena. They also talk of a valiant champion who will be fighting in the arena later in the day. I tried to brush off the chatter but as I wandered about, all I heard was more and more of this man's heroic feats. With my interest peaked, I'll be making my way to the gladiatorial ring soon.]]></entry>

    <entry id="journal_page_text_31"><![CDATA[(The journal entry is written in a very fine and elegant cursive) Typical. I took a wrong turn on my way to the arena and ended up in a rather droll part of the city which served as a home to many vulgar and unscrupulous individuals. It was only predictable that I would be stopped by a group of these thugs looking to strip me of my belongings. A rather poor choice of words and hands that touched places they shouldn't have resulted in an unpleasant series of events that took up more of my time than I had hoped. The praised hero would begin his fight soon so I hastily picked up my mirror and made my way to the coliseum.]]></entry>

    <entry id="journal_page_text_32"><![CDATA[(The journal entry is written in a very fine and elegant cursive) I just barely made it in time for the battle. Luckily one of the guards was kind enough to procure me a seat where I could best spectate the skirmish. As the gates opened, a single man emerged and I sat amongst the crowd in awe.]]></entry>

    <entry id="journal_page_text_33"><![CDATA[(The journal entry is written in a very fine and elegant cursive) The audience cheered in excitement. The warrior was the physical embodiment of perfection. His chiseled body told of a man who had seen rigorous battles while his long flowing hair would have many believe he was born from the gods. In one hand he held a fisherman's net and in the other an ornate trident. He was so perfect that I had reason to believe he had attained his beauty through obscure means, just as I had.]]></entry>

    <entry id="journal_page_text_34"><![CDATA[(The journal entry is written in a very fine and elegant cursive) Amongst the crowd's cheering admiration, the hero's adversary appeared. On the opposite side of the arena, a rusted gate opened and what emerged was a behemoth pulled in chains by beastmasters. It was a creature from a children's tale. A hulking monster covered in iron spikes and decorated with scars. The citizens greeted this thing with mocking shouts and vulgar insults. Despite this menacing beast, the champion did not show an ounce of fear, but instead smirked with confidence.]]></entry>

    <entry id="journal_page_text_35"><![CDATA[(The journal entry is written in a very fine and elegant cursive) The beastmasters released their chains and the battle began. At first I had my doubts. The monster was the size of ten men and shook the earth with every step. How could any man possibly hope to defeat such a thing? But to my surprise, the hero was succeeding. The fight looked more like a dance, with the agile warrior dodging the ogre's clumsy strikes. He stabbed at it with masterful precision and weaved around the behemoth as it mindlessly swung its boulder fists around in frustration.]]></entry>

    <entry id="journal_page_text_36"><![CDATA[(The journal entry is written in a very fine and elegant cursive) In a spectacular display, the champion thrusted his trident into the heart of the beast, causing blood to spill forth and sending the crowd into a raucous frenzy. With a loud thud, the creature collapsed and its defiling blood soaked the soil around it. The crowd continued to cheer and applaud as the hero took in their admiration. He bravely walked to the massive corpse and planted one foot on top of its metallic head. He waved to the crowd and I could have sworn he had turned to me and winked. My heart skipped a beat.]]></entry>

    <entry id="journal_page_text_37"><![CDATA[(The journal entry is written in a very fine and elegant cursive) It all happened so quickly. Our admiration quickly turned to horror as the beast revealed that it was still alive. The creature caught the hero's leg in an iron grip. It pulled the man to the ground and, with its other fist, it slammed down on the champion's face. A single scream was all we heard as the behemoth smashed the man's head and splattered bits of him all around. It slowly stood back up, covered in the gore of its victim. A moment of shock soon shifted to panic and anguish as the torn crowd began to demand justice.]]></entry>

    <entry id="journal_page_text_38"><![CDATA[(The journal entry is written in a very fine and elegant cursive) The crowd entered a vengeful frenzy as they shouted for the guards. I quickly took my leave and the last thing I saw was the beast running rampant on the beastmasters that tried to subdue it. Even as I hastily made my way out of the amphitheater's gates, I could still hear the frantic shouts of the crowd and the trembling of the earth itself. It had been interesting returning to my city of origin, but I sense a riot will soon break out and I plan to depart long before it has any effect on me.]]></entry>

    <entry id="journal_page_text_39"><![CDATA[I've been told that keeping a journal can help take my mind off the lingering dread that this wretched place can invite, so I might as well start now. We have been tasked with exploring a portion of the wealds, a place that brings back many unpleasant memories but one that I know better than anyone. I will be accompanied by Turid and Aldwin. While Turid can be brash sometimes and Aldwin reckless, they make for an effective and reliable crew. Also assigned to us is a new face, one that troubles me...]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_40"><![CDATA[We've embarked on our mission and I've already got a bad feeling. Not one hour from leaving and the new blood is already complaining. Too much walking she says, too much dirt she says. Worst is she comes to the expedition dressed in a fancy robe and wielding a broken mirror. What's her reasoning for such strange equipment? She says its "comfortable". I'll never understand these city-folk...]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_41"><![CDATA[Our first encounter in this wretched place almost ended in disaster, but the recruit pulled through. Turns out she's some witch, using her broke mirror to conjure some healing magic. Made Turid right as rain when he got stabbed by some cultist. Aldwin has taken a liking to her, but I've grown suspicious...]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_42"><![CDATA[Everything is going smoothly. I sit and write this as we rest by the campfire. The witch lady is trading compliments with Turid, some rubbish I'll never understand. Have to admit, even for a damsel raised in the cities, she is extraordinarily beautiful. Flawless skin with a soothing voice. The only thing wrong is that damn mirror of hers. Shattered and scratched up like its older than her. Very strange...]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_43"><![CDATA[Damn brigands ambushed us in the night. Different lot than the one I used to run with but their behaviour was no different. Poor Aldwin was the first victim, one of the brutes stabbed him right in the gut and sliced him open. He died laying in a pool of his own blood. Before I could even grab my bow, one of their rangers blasted my arm. Completely mangled, I'll be no use to anyone in this state. They went straight for the witch, poor thing had just woken up. I thought that'd be the end for her but I couldn't be more wrong...]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_44"><![CDATA[The damned witch dropped her mirror to reveal her hideous form. A mess of tentacle, maw, and spit, screeching at her would-be assailants. Turid ran screaming just from the sight of the thing. When one of the cutthroats took a swing at the creature, it moved with impossible speed and vomited a putrid bile from its many mouthes. The poor fools screamed in agony as their flesh melted from their bones until all that remained was a puddle of boiling blood. That alone was enough to send the whole band of thugs running, and in that moment the monstrosity turned its gaze to me. Pure instinct kicked in and I ran as fast as I could into the darkness...]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_45"><![CDATA[The wound is infected. I'm having hallucinations. My damned bird flew away during that terrible encounter and hasn't returned. I can only assume Turid has suffered the same fate as Aldwin. To think this is the way it would end, huddled under a tree haunted by the memories of that unspeakable creature. I thought I'd be redeemed for my sins, but instead I die forgotten like so many other countless souls. I thought I was ready to fight the horrors, but now I know better...]]></entry>

    <entry id="journal_page_text_53"><![CDATA[I tracked my latest hunt to the grand city. This one will be illusive, its behaviour suggests that it prefers manipulation over direct confrontation. It'll be difficult to identify the creature, given the degeneracy of this city's populace, but I will not give up my search. The Light guides me.]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_54"><![CDATA[I've found the hag. I over-estimated its intelligence, it had made itself easy to find based on its arrogant nature and abhorrent flaunting. I've announced its debaucheries to the entirety of the city populace and the hunt will soon begin.]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_55"><![CDATA[The creature fled into the foul shantytowns that sit in the city's shadow. I cannot allow such a thing to exist, so I set the entirety of the corrupted dwellings ablaze. With nowhere to run, it will surely burn for its sins.]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_56"><![CDATA[Many charred corpses were found amongst the aftermath. They are unrecognizable but I am sure that the witch can be included among them. Despite my radical actions, the cityfolk do not seem to care for those lost in the fire. Surely they must understand as I do that the loss of these peasants is a small price to pay for the eradication of evil. And so, with another monster put down for good, I continue my crusade against corruption.]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_57"><![CDATA[This will surely mark me down in the manuscripts as a hero of the Light! We have captured the heretical witch that had splintered our faith. I will be responsible for her execution, and there is no punishment more fitting for a false prophet than death by holy fire.]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_58"><![CDATA[To see the witch with my own eyes is to know pure corruption. There is no doubt that this thing is responsible for splitting the faithful followers of the Light into conflicted factions. It speaks as if it is a disciple of the Light like us, but I see through her ruse. I will commence the burning shortly.]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_59"><![CDATA[It is an abomination unlike any I've encountered! It extinguished the sanctioned fires of the pyre with ease and presented itself as an avatar of the Flame. It had converted all around me to its falsified fate and I watched in horror as both peasants and crusaders of the Light bowed in unison to this creature of debased prophecies. I retreated from its deformed presence, and now I must warn those that are still pure of its corrupting nature.]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_60"><![CDATA[The worst thing has come to reality. The creature proved too strong, and now all have come to worship it as a demigod. I have been excommunicated from what was once a faith that fought the darkness but now is a cult praising a thing that mockingly resembles an angel. Even in the face of defeat, I will not stop my hunt. This thing must die, or mankind will be damned for eternity.]]></entry>

    <entry id="journal_page_text_61"><![CDATA[Our plan is in motion. No longer will we be the weakest of the kingdoms. The sea fiends of the west and the warmongers of the north will fear us. They will know that we are the rightful rulers of this land. We are perfect beings, so it is our destiny to rule over all.]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_62"><![CDATA[Beauty can be found in the most unlikely of places. On our travels through the peasant countryside, we stumbled upon two perfect flowers. Mirror copies of each other, with unnatural beauty and poise. It is not right to leave something so precious in the filth of the common people, so we took them in. They will be a quintessential piece to our plan.]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_63"><![CDATA[They took quickly to our ways. They are a legend born in flesh. The Twin Flowers, one that trains in war, another that trains in diplomacy. Their technique is flawless, perfected, and we are eager to see disciples follow their ways. Our army forms quickly. Within years, we will have an army of perfect warriors, trained by the dual embodiment of perfection.]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_64"><![CDATA[It has been months of rigorous training, but we are beginning to see results. The Twin Flowers are training our mortal soldiers into godly disciples. The Warrior is a strict, selective, only training young men with skin as flawless as hers. She says that her technique must be matched with unearthly beauty. We do not doubt her, for we cannot begin to comprehend the lessons of a perfect being. Many soldiers have fallen from the intense training, but we know that those that survive and persevere will ascend, and vanquish our foes.]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_65"><![CDATA[This plan was decades in the making, and finally the fruits of our labor can be harvested! The Twin Flowers’ first performance was grandeur. The north kingdom could not withstand our assault. The Warrior was as graceful as she is beautiful. Dancing across the battlefield, painting the dirt with our foes’ blood as our perfect soldiers followed in her path. Our flawless army triumphed this day and they will triumph for many more. Our enemies will finally know fear, and they will bow to us in time. We prepare for celebration, tonight will be a night remembered forever.]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_66"><![CDATA[A terrible tragedy has befell us. The Twin Flowers are no more. One was found, surrounded by the corpses of our finest warriors, naked and splayed out in a pool of her own blood. The other Flower was nowhere to be found. Spiteful maledictions were posted all around the room, surely some sorcery by our most hated enemy. They knew they couldn’t fight us directly, so they sent infiltrators to kill us when we were most vulnerable. This will not be our end. We will find the lost flower, and we will rebuild our army. ]]></entry>

    <entry id="journal_page_text_67"><![CDATA[Damn it, one of the damsels escaped. Ascot must have tied the knots wrong and now the wench is out in the woods, that idiot. Mother is sending me with Jarret and Mavis to track her down. It is unsurprising, really. My day ruined by the actions of a brain dead oaf. Maybe I’ll stab him in the sack to teach him a lesson once I return.]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_68"><![CDATA[We found the maiden, but Jarret and Mavis got carried away with the hunt and killed the girl. Irritating. I returned to Mother immediately to tell her. She was furious. She gathered up the lot of us after Jarret and Mavis returned to make an example of them. “A life for a life”, she always says. Had the two of them fight to the death. They ended up killing each other. Jarret had his guts splayed out while Mavis got his skull crushed. Gruesome scene, but that’s two more jackasses I won’t have to deal with.]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_69"><![CDATA[I am being sent by Mother on another hunt. This time we’re taking us one of those “exotic” women from the east. They’re passing through here soon and I am in charge of tracking this one. That useless cockroach Ascot is coming along. He is only dead weight to me. He will be good fodder at the very least.]]></entry>	
    <entry id="journal_page_text_70"><![CDATA[We got the girl, but at heavy cost. The damn guards used some foreign fighting technique, nothing I’ve ever seen before. Caught us off guard but we outnumbered them. Ascot died in the ambush, only good thing to come of this. The damn wench doesn’t even speak sense, talking in some foreign tongue. Had to slap some quiet into her. This one better be worth whatever Mother is getting. This is more work than I prefer in a single day, and it is putting me in a worse mood.]]></entry>	
    <entry id="journal_page_text_71"><![CDATA[We brought her back to Mother, and she sent us to meet up with the lot that asked for this foreign sheep in the first place. A bunch of nobles they are. The head of them has an “acquired” taste for imported goods and is offering us bountiful amounts of food, weapons, armor, whatever we want, for this fragile thing. I will be there to oversee the trade. ]]></entry>	
    <entry id="journal_page_text_72"><![CDATA[That contemptible whorish excuse for human cattle. That slit-eyed profligate grabbed hold of my damned hood. I knocked her right off her feet like the harlot she is and she hit her pretty little head on a table. Now her blood is on my hands and Mother wants revenge. I ran as fast as I could out of there. I am not dying for some debauched little waif.]]></entry>	
    <entry id="journal_page_text_73"><![CDATA[It has been weeks, maybe even months. I lost track ever since the first hunting parties found me. That crazed hag never forgets a grudge. “A life for a life.” Nothing but deranged drivel from that witch. I never believed in her preachings, I was just in it for my own gain. Now she’s sending more and more thugs to take my head. I am better than all of them. I’ve racked up a kill count that should be feared, and it only grows with each perilous encounter.]]></entry>	
    <entry id="journal_page_text_74"><![CDATA[This is tiring. That psychotic harpy continues to send more and more of her kin to hunt me down. I cannot live like this, in constant peril of the next ambush. It is time that I find a place to hide. Maybe life as a mercenary for a noble family will suffice. Best that those pompous fools die instead me when the time comes, after all...]]></entry>

They have us all tied up, ready for whatever cruel fate they wish to inflict on us. They are slavers. I have heard of what happened to the neighboring clans, and we have become their next victims. I pray that we will be rescued soon, I cannot imagine what will become of me in this hellish place.]]></entry>	
    <entry id="journal_page_text_76"><![CDATA[(The page is dirty and hardly eligible) They treat us worse than cattle. We are given dirt to eat and left soiled. The women that have not been sold off are here with me, rotting away and wishing for death. The birds surround us, eager to feast on our broken bodies, but I feel a connection. They ask for a sacrifice in exchange for freedom. They want to know that I am willing to give. The others yell and kick them away, but I allow them to approach me. They ask for my arm’s flesh, and in exchange they will loosen my bonds. I accept.]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_77"><![CDATA[(The page is dirty and hardly eligible) Released of my bonds, I did not free the others. They refused the gifts of the flock and do not deserve the blessings I was bestowed. I carved a path of bodies as I made my way to the leader of this slavers’ group, the first of many offerings I will make to my new found family. When I finally found their leader, I did not hesitate to gouge his eyes out and leave him as one final offering for the first feast of my flock.]]></entry>	
    <entry id="journal_page_text_78"><![CDATA[(The page is dirty and hardly eligible) As for those left, I gave them a simple choice. Stay and become part of our flock, or deny us and become our offering. Many refused, and were made examples of. For those who stayed, I made it clear what we stood for. The cycle of life and death is all that matters. A life for a life is the cost for transgression. Every death is an offering, and so long as that one rule is kept, I will respect their way of life. We are shepherds for the weak, and those deemed unworthy will become an offering to our flock.]]></entry>

    <entry id="journal_page_text_30"><![CDATA[(La page de journal est écrite d'une écriture raffinée et élégante) Cela fait bien longtemps que j'ai mis les pieds dans cette grande cité. Beaucoup a changé durant mon absence. Les pitoyables travailleurs avaient été remplacés par des hommes enjoués et des femmes parlant des récents combats dans l'arène du Roi. Ils parlaient également d'un vaillant champion qui combattra dans l'arène plus tard dans la journée. J'essayais de ne pas m'intéresser à ces bavardages mais alors que 'je continuais de me promener, je n'entendais que parler des impressionnantes et héroïques prouesses de cette homme. Étant intéressée, j'allais de ce pas vers l'amphithéâtre.]]></entry>

Je passe par un détour sur mon chemin jusqu'à l'arène et j'arrive dans un quartier mal-famé de la ville servant de repaire à de nombreux individus vulgaires et sans-scrupules. Il était prévisible qu'une bande de ces vandales allaient essayer de m'arracher mes biens. Un mauvais choix de mots et des mains baladeuses ont abouti à des événements désagréables qui ont pris plus de temps que je ne l'avais espéré. Le héros acclamé allait bientôt commencer son combat, je ramassais rapidement mon miroir et traversais la ville jusqu'au colisé.]]></entry>

J'ai d'abord eu mes doutes. Le monstre faisait la taille de dix hommes et secouait la terre à chaque pas. Comment un homme pouvait-il espérer vaincre une telle chose? Je fus cependant surprise, le héros y arrivait. Le combat s'apparentait à une danse, avec l'agile guerrier esquivant les coups maladroit de l'ogre. Il l'empala avec une précision de maître et tourna autour du béhémoth tandis que celui-ci frappait, frustré et sans réfléchir avec ses poings de pierre autour de lui.]]></entry>

    <entry id="journal_page_text_36"><![CDATA[(La page de journal est écrite d'une écriture raffinée et élégante) D'une manière impressionnante, le champion planta son trident au coeur de la bête, faisant couler le sang de la bête, ce qui plongea la foule dans une frénésie rauque. La créature s'écroula d'un bruit sourd et son sang souilla le sol autour de lui. La foule continua d'acclamer et d'applaudire alors que le héros les admira en retour. Il marcha avec bravoure autour de la bête et posa son pied sur le tête métallique de son ennemi. Il salua la foule et j'aurais jurer qu'il s'était tourné vers moi en me clignant de l'oeil. Mon coeur sauta un battement.]]></entry>

    <entry id="journal_page_text_37"><![CDATA[(La page de journal est écrite d'une écriture raffinée et élégante) Tout se passa très rapidement. Notre admiration se transforma rapidement en horreur lorsque la bête se révéla encore être en vie. La créature attrapa la jambe du héros d'une main de fer. Il mit l'homme à terre, et avec son autre poing, il écrasa le visage du champion. Un seul cri retentit alors que le béhémoth brisa le crâne de l'homme en morceaux. Il se releva lentement, couvert des restes de sa victime. Le moment de choc se transforma rapidement en panique et angoisse quand la foule choquée commença à réclamer justice.]]></entry>

    <entry id="journal_page_text_38"><![CDATA[(La page de journal est écrite d'une écriture raffinée et élégante) La foule entra dans une frénésie vengeresse et cria au gardes. Je me retira rapidement et la dernière chose que je vis était la bête se retournant contre les maîtres tentant de la soumettre. Alors même que je me dirigeais à l'extérieur des portes de l'amphithéâtre, je pouvais encore entendre les cris frénétique de la foule et la terre tremblante. Ce fut intéressant de revenir à ma ville natale, mais je sens qu'une émeute allais bientôt commencer et je compte partir bien avant qu'elle ne m'affecte.]]></entry>

    <entry id="journal_page_text_39"><![CDATA[On m'a dit que tenir un journal peut aider à m'affranchir de la crainte persistante que ce lieu misérable peut procurer, alors autant commencer maintenant. Nous avons été chargés d'explorer une partie des Wealds, un lieu qui rappelle de nombreux souvenirs désagréables, mais que je connais mieux que quiconque. Je serai accompagnée par Turid et Aldwin. Bien que Turid peut être parfois impétueux et Aldwin téméraire, ils forment une équipe efficace et fiable. Une nouvelle recrue nous a également été assignée, mais cette dernière me dérange...]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_40"><![CDATA[Nous avons entrepris notre mission et j'ai déjà un mauvais pressentiment. Il ne sâest pas écoulé plus d'une heure depuis notre départ et la nouvelle se plaint déjà. Trop de marche dit-elle, trop de saleté dit-elle. Le pire est qu'elle est arrivée pour la mission vêtue d'une robe chic et brandissant un miroir cassé. Que compte-t-elle faire avec un accoutrement aussi étrange ? Elle dit que câest "confortable". Je ne comprendrai jamais ces citadins...]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_41"><![CDATA[Notre première rencontre dans ce lieu misérable a presque fini en catastrophe, mais la recrue sâen est sortie. Il s'avère qu'elle est une sorcière, qui utilise son miroir brisé pour conjurer une magie de guérison. Remettant Turid en pleine forme après avoir été poignardé par un cultiste. Aldwin semble s'être entiché dâelle, mais je suis de plus en plus méfiante...]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_42"><![CDATA[Tout se déroule sans encombre. Je m'assieds et j'écris ceci alors que nous nous reposons au feu de camp. La sorcière et Turid sâéchangent des politesses, je ne comprendrais jamais ce genre de sottises. Il faut admettre, même pour une jeune fille élevée dans les villes, elle est extraordinairement belle. Peau impeccable avec une voix apaisante. La seule chose qui ne va pas est son satané miroir quâelle ne lâche jamais. Brisé et rayé comme sâil était plus vieux quâelle. Très étrange...]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_43"><![CDATA[De maudits brigands nous ont tendu une embuscade dans la nuit. Un groupe différent de ceux avec qui jâavais lâhabitude de trainer, mais leur comportement n'était pas différent. Le pauvre Aldwin a été la première victime, une des brutes l'a poignardé dans l'intestin et lui a ouvert le bide. Il est mort étendu dans une marre de son propre sang. Avant même que je puisse atteindre mon arc, un de leurs rangers me tira dans le bras. Complètement mutilée, je n'étais plus utile à personne dans cet état. Ils ont foncé directement sur la sorcière, la pauvre chose se réveillait tout juste. Je pensais que câen était fini dâelle, mais je nâaurais pas pu mâêtre trompée plus...]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_44"><![CDATA[La maudite sorcière lâcha son miroir pour révéler sa forme hideuse. Un fatra de tentacules, de gueules, et de salive, hurlant sur ses assaillants. Turid s'enfuit en criant à la simple vue de la chose. Quand l'un des coupe-gorges tenta de poignarder la créature, elle se déplaça avec une vitesse incroyable et vomit une bile putride de ses bouches multiples. Les pauvres imbéciles criaient d'agonie alors que leur chair fondait et se détachait de leurs os jusqu'à ce qu'il nâen reste plus quâune flaque de sang bouillonnant. Ce fut suffisant pour faire fuir le reste de la bande de voyous, et à ce moment la monstruosité tourna son regard vers moi. Mon instinct prit le dessus et j'ai couru aussi vite que possible dans l'obscurité ...]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_45"><![CDATA[La plaie est infectée. J'ai des hallucinations. Mon maudit oiseau s'est envolé lors de cette terrible rencontre et n'est pas rentré. Je suppose que Turid a subi le même sort que Aldwin. Dire que ça va se finir comme ça, blottie sous un arbre, hantée par les souvenirs de cette créature indescriptible. Je pensais que j'allais racheter mes péchés, mais au lieu de cela je meurs oubliée comme tant d'autres innombrables âmes. Je pensais que j'étais prête à combattre les horreurs, mais maintenant je sais...]]></entry>

    <entry id="journal_page_text_53"><![CDATA[J'ai traqué ma dernière proie jusqu'à la grande ville. Celle-ci est insaisissable, son comportement suggère qu'elle préfère la manipulation à la confrontation directe.. Il va m'être difficile d'identifier la créature, étant donnée la dégénérescence de la population de cette ville, mais je n'abandonnerai pas mes recherches. La Lumière me guide.]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_54"><![CDATA[J'ai trouvé la sorcière. J'ai surestimé son intelligence, elle s'est faite simple à trouver due à sa nature arrogante et son exhibition horrible. J'ai annoncé sa débauche à toute la populace de la cité et la chasse commencera bientôt.]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_55"><![CDATA[La créature a fuit dans les bidonvilles fétides qui sieds dans l'ombre de la ville. Je ne peux pas permettre à une telle chose d'exister, j'ai donc embrasé la totalité des habitations corrompus. Avec nulle part o fuir, elle brûlera sûrement pour ses péchés.]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_56"><![CDATA[De nombreux corps calcinés furent trouvé à la suite de l'incendie. Elles sont méconnaissables mais je suis certain que la sorcière en faisait parti. Malgré mes actions radicales, les citoyens ne semblent pas prêter attention à ceux morts dans le feu. Ils doivent sûrement comprendre de la même manière que moi que la perte de ces paysans est un petit prix à payer pour l'éradication du mal. Et ainsi, avec un autre monstre abbatu à jamais, je continue ma croisade contre la corruption.]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_57"><![CDATA[Cela m'inscrira sûrement dans les manuscrits comme un héros de la Lumière! Nous avons capturés l'hérétique sorcière qui avait scindé notre foi. Je serais responsable de son exécution, et aucune punition n'est plus appropriée pour un faux prophète que la mort dans le feu sacré.]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_58"><![CDATA[Voir cette sorcière de mes propres yeux c'est connaître la corruption la plus profonde. Il n'y a aucun doutes que cette chose est responsable d'avoir scindé les fidèles de la Lumière en deux factions en conflits. Elle parle comme un disciple de la Lumière, juste comme nous, mais je peux voir son stratagème dans ses yeux. Je commencerais le bûcher sous peu.]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_59"><![CDATA[Il s'agit d'une abomination comme je n'ai jamais rencontré! Elle a éteint les feu sanctifiés du bûcher avec facilité et s'est présentée comme un Avatar de la Flamme. Elle a convertie tous ceux autours de moi à son destin falsifié et j'observa avec horreurs à la fois les paysans et les croisés de la Lumière s'agenouiller à l'unisson devant cette créature faite de prophéties dégradées. J'ai battu en retraite devant sa présence déformée, et je dois maintenant avertir ceux qui sont encore purs de sa nature corrompante.]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_60"><![CDATA[La pire chose est arrivée. La créature s'est montrée trop forte, et maintenant tous la vénère comme un demi-dieu. J'ai été excommunié de ce qui été jadis la foi qui combattait les ténèbres mais désormais un culte se dévouant à une chose ressemblant à un ange burlesque. Même face à la défaite, je n'arrêterai pas ma chasse. Cette chose doit mourir, o l'humanité est peut-être damnée pour l'éternité.]]></entry>

    <entry id="journal_page_text_61"><![CDATA[Notre plan est en marche. Désormais nous ne serons plus le plus faible des royaumes. Les pillards marins de l'Ouest et les porte-guerres du Nord nous craindrons. Ils sauront tous que nous sommes les dirigeants légitimes de cette terre. Nous sommes des êtres parfaits, il est donc notre destin de les diriger tous.]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_62"><![CDATA[La Beauté peut se trouver dans les lieux les plus incongrus. Lors de nos voyages à travers la campagne paysanne, nous tombâmes face à deux fleurs parfaites. Des copies parfaites l'une de l'autre, et d'une beauté et d'un équilibre surnaturel. Il ne serait pas bien de laisser quelque chose de si précieux au milieu de la saleté et la populace, alors nous les avons emmenées avec nous. Elles seront la quintessence de notre plan.]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_63"><![CDATA[Elles ont vite suivi nos voies. Elles sont des légendes incarnées. Les Fleurs Jumelles, une qui s'entraîne à la guerre, l'autre à la diplomatie. Leurs techniques sont sans failles, perfectionnées, et nous avons hâte de voir des disciples suivre leurs voies. Nos armées se forment rapidement. Dans les prochaines années, nous aurons une armée de soldats parfaits, entraînés par la double incarnation de la perfection.]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_64"><![CDATA[Cela fait des mois d'entraînement rigoureux, mais l'on commence à voir des résultats. Les Fleurs Jumelles transforment nos mortels soldats en de divin disciples. La Guerrière est stricte, sélective, et n'entraîne que les jeunes hommes avec un peau aussi parfaite que la sienne. Elle dit que sa technique doit être de paire avec une beauté surnaturelle. Nous ne doutons pas d'elle, car il est inutile d'essayer de   comprendre les leçons d'un être parfait. De nombreux soldats sont tombés face à l'effort intense, mais nous savons que ceux qui survivent et persévèrent connaîtront l'ascension, et vaincrons nos ennemis.]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_65"><![CDATA[Cela fait des dizaines d'années que nous préparons notre plan, et enfin le fruit de notre labeur va être récolté ! La première performance des Fleurs Jumelles était splendide. Le Royaume du Nord n'as pas résisté à notre assaut. La Guerrière était aussi grâcieuse qu'elle est magnifique. Dansant à travers le champ de bataille, peignant la terre avec le sang de nos ennemis tandis que nos soldats parfaits suivaient son chemin. Nos armées sans failles ont triomphées aujourd'hui et triompheront de nombreux autres jours. Nos ennemis connaîtront la peur, et en temps venu ils s'agenouilleront devant nous. Nous préparons une fête, cette nuit sera honorée pour toujours.]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_66"><![CDATA[Une terrible tragédie nous a frappée. Les Fleurs Jumelles ne sont plus. Une fut trouvée, entourée par les corps de nos plus fins guerriers, nue et plongée dans un bain de son propre sang. L'autre Fleur n'as pas été retrouvée. Des malédictions rancunières étaient réparties dans toute la pièce, sûrement de la sorcellerie de notre ennemi le plus haïs. Ils savaient qu'ils ne pourraient pas nous vaincre directement, ils ont donc envoyés des infiltrés pour nous tuer quand nous étions le plus vulnérables. Ce ne sera pas notre fin. Nous trouverons la Fleur perdue, et nous reconstruirons notre armée.]]></entry>

    <entry id="journal_page_text_67"><![CDATA[Bon sang, une des demoiselles c’est échappée. Ascot as du mal faire les nœuds et maintenant la fillette est dans les bois, quel idiot. Mère m’envoie avec Jarret et Mavis pour la traquer. Ce n’est vraiment pas surprenant. Ma journée ruinée à cause des actions d’un crétin sans cervelle. Peut-être que je lui donnerai un coup dans le sac en rentrant, histoire qu’il retienne la leçon.]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_68"><![CDATA[On a trouvé la jeune fille, mais Jarret et Mavis se sont emportés avec la chasse et on tués la fille. C’est irritant. Je suis revenue voir Mère immédiatement pour lui dire. Elle était furieuse. Lorsque Jarret et Mavis revinrent, elle nous appella pour montrer l’exemple. “Une vie pour une vie”, comme elle dit toujours. Elle les fit se combattre à mort. Ils ont finis par s’entretuer. Jarret avait ses tripes à l’air tandis que Mavis c’est fait fracassé le crâne. Une scène macabre, mais ça fait deux imbéciles en moins à qui je n’aurais plus à fréquenter.]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_69"><![CDATA[J’ai été envoyée par Mère pour une autre chasse. Cette fois on ramène une de ces femme “exotiques” de l’Est. Ils passent par ici bientôt et je suis en charge de la traque de celle-ci. Ce cafard inutile qu’est Ascot viens avec nous. Pour moi c’est un poids mort. Il fera de la bonne chair à canon au moins.]]></entry>	
    <entry id="journal_page_text_70"><![CDATA[On a eu la fille, mais pour un lourd tribut. Les satanés gardes utilisaient une technique de combat étrangère, rien que je n’ai vu auparavant. Ça nous a pris au dépourvu mais nous étions trop nombreux pour eux. Ascot est mort lors de l'embuscade, c’est la seule bonne chose qu’on en a tiré. La femme ne parle même pas censément, juste une langue étrangère. J’ai dû la frapper pour qu’elle se taise. Elle as intérêt à valoir quelque chose pour Mère. Ça fait plus de travail que j’aimerais en avoir en une journée, et ça me met encore plus de mauvaise humeur.]]></entry>	
    <entry id="journal_page_text_71"><![CDATA[Nous l’avons amenée à Mère, et elle nous envoya rencontrer avec le lot qui ont demandés ce mouton étranger. Une bande de nobles. À leur tête, un homme ayant un goût “acquis” pour les biens importés et qui nous offre en retour une généreuse livrée de nourriture, armes, armures, tout ce qu’on veut, pour cette fragile chose. Je serais là pour superviser l’échange.]]></entry>

Je l’ai giflée comme la prostituée qu’elle est, elle perdit son équilibre et cogna sa magnifique petite tête sur une table. Maintenant son sang est sur mes mains et Mère veut sa vengeance. J’ai couru aussi vite que je le pouvais d’ici. Je ne vais pas mourir pour une misérable enfant débauchée.]]></entry>	
    <entry id="journal_page_text_73"><![CDATA[Cela fait des semaines, peut-être des mois. J’ai perdu le compte depuis que les premières équipes de chasse m’ont trouvés. Cette harpie folle n’oublie pas sa rancune. “Une vie pour une vie”. Rien que des bavardages dérangés sortant de cette sorcière. Je n’ai jamais crue en ses prédications, j’étais juste là pour mes propres intérêts. Maintenant elle envoie de plus en plus de voyous pour ma tête. Je suis meilleure qu’eux tous. J’accumule un nombre de tués qui devrait inspirer la peur. Et il ne fait que grandir avec chaque rencontres plus périlleuses les unes que les autres.]]></entry>	
    <entry id="journal_page_text_74"><![CDATA[C’est fatiguant. Cette harpie psychotique continue d’envoyer de ses pions pour me chasser. Je ne peux pas vivre comme ça, en constant péril d’être embusquée. Il est temps que je trouve un lieu pour me cacher. Peut-être une vie de mercenaire pour une famille noble me suffira. Il vaut mieux que ce soit ses imbéciles pompeux qui meurent à ma place quand le temps viendra, après tout...]]></entry>

Les oiseaux nous entourent, désireux de festoyer sur nos corps brisés, mais je sens une connection. Ils demandent un sacrifice en échange de leur liberté. Ils veulent savoir ce que je suis prête à donner. Les autres crient et les repoussent, mais je leur permet de m’approcher.

Rester et rejoindre notre envol, ou nous dénier et devenir notre offrande. De nombreux ont refusés, et sont devenus des exemples. Pour ceux qui sont restés, j’ai fait comprendre ce que nous représentions. Le cycle de la vie et la mort est tout ce qui importe. Une vie pour une vie est le coût d’une transgression. Chaque mort est une offrande, et tant que cette seule règle est gardée, je respecterai leur manière de vivre. Nous sommes les bergers des faibles, et ceux jugés indignes deviendront une offrande pour notre envol.]]></entry>

Ich hauche meinem Befreier ein wortloses Dankeschön zu, während er sich in die Schatten davonschlängelt. Endlich bin ich frei von meinem goldenen Käfig. Endlich verstehe ich: Ein Ding kann erst dann wahrhaftig schön sein, nachdem es zerbrochen wurde.]]></entry>

    <entry id="journal_page_text_29"><![CDATA[(Der Tagebucheintrag ist in einer sehr eleganten und feinen Schrift geschrieben worden) An denjenigen der dieses Tagebuch gerade am lesen ist. Dies ist ein privates Tagebuch. Ich möchte sie darum bitten, davon abzusehen weiterzulesen und es dem rechtmäßigen Besitzer zurückzugeben. Meinen Aufenthaltsort, finden sie auf der Karte verzeichnet. (Beigefügt findet sich eine detaillierte Landkarte des Anwesens. Die Wegbeschreibungen sind allerdings verschmiert und unlesbar)]]></entry>

    <entry id="journal_page_text_30"><![CDATA[(Der Tagebucheintrag ist in einer sehr eleganten und feinen Schrift geschrieben worden) Es ist schon eine Weile her dass ich einen Fuß in diese Stadt gesetzt habe. Vieles hat sich geändert in meiner Abwesenheit. Die grimmigen Arbeiter wurden durch fröhliche Männer und Frauen ersetzt die sich ausschließlich über die letzten Kämpfe in der Arena des Königs unterhielten. Sie redeten außerdem dauernd von einem wackeren Kämpfer der heute noch, später am Abend in der Arena antreten würde. Ich habe versucht diese Gespräche zu ignorieren, doch überall wo ich hinging hörte ich bloß mehr und mehr von diesem Mann und seinen heroischen Wundertaten. Das ganze hat nun mein Interesse geweckt. Ich werde mich bald auf den Weg zur Arena machen.]]></entry>

    <entry id="journal_page_text_31"><![CDATA[(Der Tagebucheintrag ist in einer sehr eleganten und feinen Schrift geschrieben worden) Typisch. Ich bin auf dem Weg zur Arena falsch abgebogen und landete in einem ziemlich abstoßenden Teil der Stadt der als Zuhause für jede Menge vulgärer und skrupelloser Individuen dient. Es war wohl voraussehbar, dass ich bald von einem Schlägertrupp aufgehalten werden würde der darauf aus ist mir meine Habseligkeiten abzunehmen. Einige schlecht gewählte Worte und Hände die Dinge angefasst haben die sie lieber hätten nicht anfassen sollen, resultierten dann letztendlich in einer Reihe bedauernswerter Ereignisse, die mir noch mehr meiner Zeit geraubt haben als ich gehofft hatte. Der gelobte Held müsste seinen Kampf bald beginnen, also schnappte ich mir rasch meinen Spiegel und eilte im Laufschritt in Richtung Kolosseum.]]></entry>

    <entry id="journal_page_text_32"><![CDATA[(Der Tagebucheintrag ist in einer sehr eleganten und feinen Schrift geschrieben worden) Ich habe es noch gerade so rechtzeitig zum Kampf in die Arena geschafft. Glücklicherweise war einer der Wärter freundlich genug mir einen Sitzplatz zu verschaffen, von dem aus ich das Scharmützel beobachten konnte. Als sich die Tore öffneten, trat ein Mann heraus, während ich ehrfürchtig inmitten der Zuschauerreihen saß.]]></entry>

    <entry id="journal_page_text_33"><![CDATA[(Der Tagebucheintrag ist in einer sehr eleganten und feinen Schrift geschrieben worden) Die Zuschauer jubelten vor Aufregung. Der Krieger war die Personifizierung des Wortes Perfektion. Während sein langes fließendes Haar einen glauben ließ er wurde von den Göttern selbst geschaffen, erzählte sein wie aus Stein gemeißelter Körper, die Geschichte eines Mannes der bereits zahlreiche harte Schlachten erfolgreich hinter sich gebracht hat. In der einen Hand hielt er ein Fischernetz und in der anderen ein verzierten Dreizack. Er war dermaßen Perfekt, dass ich allen Grund dazu hatte anzunehmen er bekam seine Schönheit durch eine finstere Kraft. Genau wie ich.]]></entry>

    <entry id="journal_page_text_34"><![CDATA[(Der Tagebucheintrag ist in einer sehr eleganten und feinen Schrift geschrieben worden) Inmitten des Applauses der Zuschauer betrat sein Gegenspieler das Feld. Auf der entgegen liegenden Seite der Arena öffnete sich ein verrostetes Tor und was heraus trat war ein Monstrum das von seinen Meistern in Ketten in die Arena geführt wurde. Es war eine Kreatur wie aus einer Gruselgeschichte für Kinder Ein gewaltiges Monster das mit eisernen Stacheln bedeckt und mit Narben verziert war. Die Anwohner begrüßten dieses Ding mit spöttischen Rufen und vulgären Beleidigungen. Trotz des Anblicks dieses bedrohlichen Biestes, zeigte der Kämpfer keine Furcht, er grinste stattdessen voller Selbstbewusstsein.]]></entry>

    <entry id="journal_page_text_35"><![CDATA[(Der Tagebucheintrag ist in einer sehr eleganten und feinen Schrift geschrieben worden) Die Meister befreiten das Geschöpf von seinen Ketten und der Kampf begann. Zuerst hatte ich meine Zweifel. Das Monster war so groß wie 10 Männer und die Erde bebte bei jedem seiner Schritte. Wie in aller Welt könnte ein einzelner Mann auch nur davon träumen so ein Ding zu erlegen? Doch zu meiner Überraschung, hatte der Held die Oberhand. Der Kampf sah für ihn viel mehr wie ein Tanz aus, mit dem flinken Krieger, der den unbeholfenen Schlägen eines Ogers ausweicht. Er stach mit meisterhafter Präzision zu und wirbelte um das Ungetüm herum während es mit seinen stahlharten Fäusten frustriert um sich schlug.]]></entry>

    <entry id="journal_page_text_36"><![CDATA[(Der Tagebucheintrag ist in einer sehr eleganten und feinen Schrift geschrieben worden)  In einer spektakulären Darbietung, stieß der Held seinen Dreizack mitten ins Herz des Biestes. Das austretende Blut der Bestie versetzte die Zuschauermenge in eine lärmende Extase. Mit einem lauten dumpfen Aufprall stürzte das Monstrum zu Boden, und der Sand saugte sein verdorbenes Blut um es herum auf. Die Menge jubelte weiter und applaudierte während der Held sich feiern lies. Mutig stolzierte er auf den massiven Leichnam zu, platzierte seinen Fuß auf dem metallenen Kopf der Kreatur während er der Masse zu winkte. Ich hätte schwören können währenddessen sah er zu mir hinüber und zwinkerte. Mein Herz setzte kurz aus.]]></entry>

    <entry id="journal_page_text_37"><![CDATA[(Der Tagebucheintrag ist in einer sehr eleganten und feinen Schrift geschrieben worden) Unsere Bewunderung wandelte sich ganz schnell in blankes Entsetzen um als das Monstrum offenbarte dass es noch immer am Leben war. Es schnappte sich mit einem eisernen Griff das Bein des Helden, schleuderte ihn zu Boden und rammte seine anderen Hand, zur Faust geballt, auf Kopf des Helden. Ein kurzer Schrei war alles was wir hörten, als das Ungeheuer den Kopf des Mannes zertrümmerte und Teile davon überall durch die Gegend spritzte. Das Monstrum erhob sich langsam wieder. überzogen mit dem Blut seines Opfers. Der kurze Moment des Entsetzens wandelte sich daraufhin zur blanken Panik und Verzweiflung. Die Zuschauer verlangten nach Gerechtigkeit.]]></entry>

    <entry id="journal_page_text_38"><![CDATA[(Der Tagebucheintrag ist in einer sehr eleganten und feinen Schrift geschrieben worden) Ein rachsüchtiger Tumult brach unter den Zuschauern aus während sie nach den Wachen riefen. Ich machte mich umgehend auf den Heimweg und das letzte was ich sehen konnte, war wie das Biest ungezügelt auf die Zwingermeister losging die versuchten es wieder zu bändigen. Selbst noch als ich hastig aus dem Amphitheater hinaus stürmte, konnte ich noch immer die verzweifelten Schreie hören und spüren wie der Boden unter meinen Füßen bebte. Die Rückkehr in meine Heimat war interessant muss ich eingestehen aber ich spüre das bald Unruhen ausbrechen werden. Ich werde lange verschwunden sein bevor sie mich in Mitleidenschaft ziehen können.]]></entry>

    <entry id="journal_page_text_39"><![CDATA[Mir wurde gesagt dass ein Tagebuch zu führen dabei helfen kann, die Gemüter vor den lauernden Schrecken, die einen in diesem elenden Ort erwarten, zu beruhigen. Deswegen fange ich nun damit an. Wir wurden damit beauftragt, einen Teil des Waldes auszukundschaften. Ein Ort der in mir zwar sehr viele unangenehme Erinnerungen hervorruft, den ich jedoch so gut kenne wie kein Zweiter. Turid und Aldwin begleiten mich. Während Turid manchmal ein bisschen frech sein kann und Aldwin ziemlich rücksichtslos, bilden die beiden doch ein effizientes und zuverlässiges Team. Desweiteren wurde uns noch ein neues Gesicht zugeteilt, eins das mich beunruhigt...]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_40"><![CDATA[Noch während wir auf dem Weg zu unserer Mission waren bekam ich schon ein ungutes Gefühl. Kaum eine Stunde ist vergangen seitdem wir aufgebrochen sind und schon fängt die neue an sich zu beschweren. "Zuviel Lauferei" meckert sie "Zuviel Schmutz" meckert sie. Und als wäre das nicht schon genug kommt sie gekleidet in einer schicken Robe und bewaffnet mit einem zerbrochenen Spiegel mit zur Expedition. Ich frage sie warum sie eine solch seltsame Ausrüstung mit sich führt? "Es ist gemütlich" antwortet sie. Ich werde diese Stadtmenschen niemals verstehen...]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_41"><![CDATA[Unsere erste Auseinandersetzung an diesem elenden Ort endete beinahe in einem Desaster, aber die neue Rekrutin hat uns durchgebracht. Es stellte sich heraus dass sie eine Art Hexe ist die ihren Spiegel für irgendeine Art Heilzauber verwendet. Sie ließ Turid beinahe augenblicklich wieder auferstehen nachdem er von einem Kultisten niedergestochen wurde. Aldwin scheint Gefallen an ihr zu finden aber ich werde langsam misstrauisch...]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_42"><![CDATA[Alles läuft wunderbar. Ich sitze und schreibe diese Zeilen während wir an einem Lagerfeuer sitzen. Die Hexenfrau und Turid tauschen Komplimente aus, ein Blödsinn den ich niemals verstehen werde. Ich muss aber zugeben, für so eine Jungfrau die in der Stadt groß geworden ist ist sie ausserordentlich hübsch. Eine makellose Haut mit einer sehr sanften Stimme. Das einzige an ihr was nicht Stimmt, ist dieser verdammte Spiegel von ihr. Zerbrochen und zerkratzt als wäre er noch älter als sie es ist. ußerst sonderbar...]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_43"><![CDATA[Diese verfluchten Briganten haben uns in der Nacht überfallen. Andere als die mit denen ich früher unterwegs gewesen bin jedoch mit dem selben Verhalten. Der arme Aldwin war das erste Opfer. Einer der Rüpel stach ihm direkt in den Bauch und schlitzte ihn auf. Er starb liegend in einer Lache seines eigenen Blutes. Noch bevor ich in der Lage war mir meinen Bogen zu schnappen, schoss mir einer der Briganten in den Arm. Komplett verstümmelt und hilflos, war ich in dieser Verfassung niemandem mehr von nutze. Anschließend gingen sie geradewegs auf die Hexe los. Armes Ding. Sie war grade erst aufgewacht. Ich bin davon ausgegangen dass dies ihr ende sein wird aber noch nie in meinem Leben lag ich so falsch...]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_44"><![CDATA[Die verfluchte Hexe ließ ihren Spiegel fallen um ihre abscheuliche Gestalt zu offenbaren. Ein Chaos aus Tentakeln und Mäulern mit ätzendem Speichel schreite ihre Angreifer an. Turid ergriff allein von dem Anblick dieses Dings schreiend die Flucht. Als die Wegelagerer der Kreatur einen Hieb verpassen wollten, bewegte es sich mit einer nahezu unmöglichen Schnelligkeit und speite mit einer ätzenden Galle aus ihren vielen Mäulern auf ihre Angreifer. Die armen Narren schreiten qualvoll während ihnen das Fleisch von den Knochen schmolz bis nur noch eine Pfütze kochenden Blutes übrig war. Das alleine war genug um die gesamte Schar der Briganten in die Flucht zu schlagen. Als die Kreatur mir ihren Blick zuwarf setzte mein Instinkt wieder ein und ich rannte so schnell ich nur konnte in die Finsternis...]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_45"><![CDATA[Die Wunde hat sich entzündet. Ich habe Halluzinationen. Mein verdammter Vogel ist in diesem heillosen Durcheinander weggeflogen und bis jetzt noch nicht zurückgekehrt.  Ich kann nur annehmen das Turid das selbe Schicksal ereilt hat wie Aldwin. Ich dachte nicht dass es so zuende geht, kauernd unter einem Baum, und heimgesucht von Erinnerungen an diese grauenhafte Kreatur. Ich habe Gedacht ich werde von meinen Sünden erlöst, doch stattdessen sterbe ich vergessen von der Welt wie unzählige Seelen vor mir es bereits taten. Ich dachte ich wäre dazu in der Lage gewesen die Schrecken zu bekämpfen, doch ich wurde eines besseren belehrt...]]></entry>

    <entry id="journal_page_text_53"><![CDATA[I tracked my latest hunt to the grand city. This one will be illusive, its behaviour suggests that it prefers manipulation over direct confrontation. It'll be difficult to identify the creature, given the degeneracy of this city's populace, but I will not give up my search. The Light guides me.]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_54"><![CDATA[I've found the hag. I over-estimated its intelligence, it had made itself easy to find based on its arrogant nature and abhorrent flaunting. I've announced its debaucheries to the entirety of the city populace and the hunt will soon begin.]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_55"><![CDATA[The creature fled into the foul shantytowns that sit in the city's shadow. I cannot allow such a thing to exist, so I set the entirety of the corrupted dwellings ablaze. With nowhere to run, it will surely burn for its sins.]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_56"><![CDATA[Many charred corpses were found amongst the aftermath. They are unrecognizable but I am sure that the witch can be included among them. Despite my radical actions, the cityfolk do not seem to care for those lost in the fire. Surely they must understand as I do that the loss of these peasants is a small price to pay for the eradication of evil. And so, with another monster put down for good, I continue my crusade against corruption.]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_57"><![CDATA[This will surely mark me down in the manuscripts as a hero of the Light! We have captured the heretical witch that had splintered our faith. I will be responsible for her execution, and there is no punishment more fitting for a false prophet than death by holy fire.]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_58"><![CDATA[To see the witch with my own eyes is to know pure corruption. There is no doubt that this thing is responsible for splitting the faithful followers of the Light into conflicted factions. It speaks as if it is a disciple of the Light like us, but I see through her ruse. I will commence the burning shortly.]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_59"><![CDATA[It is an abomination unlike any I've encountered! It extinguished the sanctioned fires of the pyre with ease and presented itself as an avatar of the Flame. It had converted all around me to its falsified fate and I watched in horror as both peasants and crusaders of the Light bowed in unison to this creature of debased prophecies. I retreated from its deformed presence, and now I must warn those that are still pure of its corrupting nature.]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_60"><![CDATA[The worst thing has come to reality. The creature proved too strong, and now all have come to worship it as a demigod. I have been excommunicated from what was once a faith that fought the darkness but now is a cult praising a thing that mockingly resembles an angel. Even in the face of defeat, I will not stop my hunt. This thing must die, or mankind will be damned for eternity.]]></entry>

    <entry id="journal_page_text_61"><![CDATA[Our plan is in motion. No longer will we be the weakest of the kingdoms. The sea fiends of the west and the warmongers of the north will fear us. They will know that we are the rightful rulers of this land. We are perfect beings, so it is our destiny to rule over all.]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_62"><![CDATA[Beauty can be found in the most unlikely of places. On our travels through the peasant countryside, we stumbled upon two perfect flowers. Mirror copies of each other, with unnatural beauty and poise. It is not right to leave something so precious in the filth of the common people, so we took them in. They will be a quintessential piece to our plan.]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_63"><![CDATA[They took quickly to our ways. They are a legend born in flesh. The Twin Flowers, one that trains in war, another that trains in diplomacy. Their technique is flawless, perfected, and we are eager to see disciples follow their ways. Our army forms quickly. Within years, we will have an army of perfect warriors, trained by the dual embodiment of perfection.]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_64"><![CDATA[It has been months of rigorous training, but we are beginning to see results. The Twin Flowers are training our mortal soldiers into godly disciples. The Warrior is a strict, selective, only training young men with skin as flawless as hers. She says that her technique must be matched with unearthly beauty. We do not doubt her, for we cannot begin to comprehend the lessons of a perfect being. Many soldiers have fallen from the intense training, but we know that those that survive and persevere will ascend, and vanquish our foes.]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_65"><![CDATA[This plan was decades in the making, and finally the fruits of our labor can be harvested! The Twin Flowers’ first performance was grandeur. The north kingdom could not withstand our assault. The Warrior was as graceful as she is beautiful. Dancing across the battlefield, painting the dirt with our foes’ blood as our perfect soldiers followed in her path. Our flawless army triumphed this day and they will triumph for many more. Our enemies will finally know fear, and they will bow to us in time. We prepare for celebration, tonight will be a night remembered forever.]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_66"><![CDATA[A terrible tragedy has befell us. The Twin Flowers are no more. One was found, surrounded by the corpses of our finest warriors, naked and splayed out in a pool of her own blood. The other Flower was nowhere to be found. Spiteful maledictions were posted all around the room, surely some sorcery by our most hated enemy. They knew they couldn’t fight us directly, so they sent infiltrators to kill us when we were most vulnerable. This will not be our end. We will find the lost flower, and we will rebuild our army. ]]></entry>

    <entry id="journal_page_text_67"><![CDATA[Damn it, one of the damsels escaped. Ascot must have tied the knots wrong and now the wench is out in the woods, that idiot. Mother is sending me with Jarret and Mavis to track her down. It is unsurprising, really. My day ruined by the actions of a brain dead oaf. Maybe I’ll stab him in the sack to teach him a lesson once I return.]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_68"><![CDATA[We found the maiden, but Jarret and Mavis got carried away with the hunt and killed the girl. Irritating. I returned to Mother immediately to tell her. She was furious. She gathered up the lot of us after Jarret and Mavis returned to make an example of them. “A life for a life”, she always says. Had the two of them fight to the death. They ended up killing each other. Jarret had his guts splayed out while Mavis got his skull crushed. Gruesome scene, but that’s two more jackasses I won’t have to deal with.]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_69"><![CDATA[I am being sent by Mother on another hunt. This time we’re taking us one of those “exotic” women from the east. They’re passing through here soon and I am in charge of tracking this one. That useless cockroach Ascot is coming along. He is only dead weight to me. He will be good fodder at the very least.]]></entry>	
    <entry id="journal_page_text_70"><![CDATA[We got the girl, but at heavy cost. The damn guards used some foreign fighting technique, nothing I’ve ever seen before. Caught us off guard but we outnumbered them. Ascot died in the ambush, only good thing to come of this. The damn wench doesn’t even speak sense, talking in some foreign tongue. Had to slap some quiet into her. This one better be worth whatever Mother is getting. This is more work than I prefer in a single day, and it is putting me in a worse mood.]]></entry>	
    <entry id="journal_page_text_71"><![CDATA[We brought her back to Mother, and she sent us to meet up with the lot that asked for this foreign sheep in the first place. A bunch of nobles they are. The head of them has an “acquired” taste for imported goods and is offering us bountiful amounts of food, weapons, armor, whatever we want, for this fragile thing. I will be there to oversee the trade. ]]></entry>	
    <entry id="journal_page_text_72"><![CDATA[That contemptible whorish excuse for human cattle. That slit-eyed profligate grabbed hold of my damned hood. I knocked her right off her feet like the harlot she is and she hit her pretty little head on a table. Now her blood is on my hands and Mother wants revenge. I ran as fast as I could out of there. I am not dying for some debauched little waif.]]></entry>	
    <entry id="journal_page_text_73"><![CDATA[It has been weeks, maybe even months. I lost track ever since the first hunting parties found me. That crazed hag never forgets a grudge. “A life for a life.” Nothing but deranged drivel from that witch. I never believed in her preachings, I was just in it for my own gain. Now she’s sending more and more thugs to take my head. I am better than all of them. I’ve racked up a kill count that should be feared, and it only grows with each perilous encounter.]]></entry>	
    <entry id="journal_page_text_74"><![CDATA[This is tiring. That psychotic harpy continues to send more and more of her kin to hunt me down. I cannot live like this, in constant peril of the next ambush. It is time that I find a place to hide. Maybe life as a mercenary for a noble family will suffice. Best that those pompous fools die instead me when the time comes, after all...]]></entry>

They have us all tied up, ready for whatever cruel fate they wish to inflict on us. They are slavers. I have heard of what happened to the neighboring clans, and we have become their next victims. I pray that we will be rescued soon, I cannot imagine what will become of me in this hellish place.]]></entry>

The women that have not been sold off are here with me, rotting away and wishing for death. The birds surround us, eager to feast on our broken bodies, but I feel a connection. They ask for a sacrifice in exchange for freedom. They want to know that I am willing to give. The others yell and kick them away, but I allow them to approach me. They ask for my arm’s flesh, and in exchange they will loosen my bonds. I accept.]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_77"><![CDATA[(The page is dirty and hardly eligible) Released of my bonds, I did not free the others. They refused the gifts of the flock and do not deserve the blessings I was bestowed. I carved a path of bodies as I made my way to the leader of this slavers’ group, the first of many offerings I will make to my new found family. When I finally found their leader, I did not hesitate to gouge his eyes out and leave him as one final offering for the first feast of my flock.]]></entry>	
    <entry id="journal_page_text_78"><![CDATA[(The page is dirty and hardly eligible) As for those left, I gave them a simple choice. Stay and become part of our flock, or deny us and become our offering. Many refused, and were made examples of. For those who stayed, I made it clear what we stood for. The cycle of life and death is all that matters. A life for a life is the cost for transgression. Every death is an offering, and so long as that one rule is kept, I will respect their way of life. We are shepherds for the weak, and those deemed unworthy will become an offering to our flock.]]></entry>

    <entry id="journal_page_text_22"><![CDATA[Powiadają, żem jest wcieleniem Piękna. Żem jest nieskazitelna niczym ocean wydm. Łagodna niczym pustynny wiatr. Urzekająca niczym miraż. Wpatrują się we mnie, oczekują, pożerają mnie wygłodniałymi oczami.]]></entry>

    <entry id="journal_page_text_23"><![CDATA[Taką wykwintność można jeno wielbić, mówią. I tak też muszę tańczyć. Ku uciesze ich uwalanych rozpaczą i brudem twarzy. Ku satysfakcji ich wodnistych, przekrwionych oczu. Ku zadowoleniu ich spękanych ust. Dla tej rozpustnej gawiedzi nie jestem człowiekiem. Jestem egzotyczną nowinką. Wcieleniem Piękna.]]></entry>

    <entry id="journal_page_text_24"><![CDATA[Miejsce Piękna jest w pałacu, rzeczą. Moje ręce zostają skrępowane, a ja trafiam na karawanę obok złotych figurek bożków i ikon wysadzanych drogocennymi kamieniami. Stanowimy olśniewający dar. Jesteśmy ładunkiem i zmierzamy wprost do skarbca Wezyra. Słyszałam o tym tyranie i lękam się tego, co mnie czeka.]]></entry>

    <entry id="journal_page_text_25"><![CDATA[Gdy wóz pnie się z mozołem wzdłuż górskiej ścieżki, podejmuję decyzję. Nie trafię w ręce Wezyra. Nie stanę się jego trofeum. Wyswobadzam się z więzów i z bezwiednym zgoła wdziękiem daję się porwać rytmowi. Wóz chwieje się, a strażnicy podnoszą larum. Koła odrywają się od ziemi, konie rżą z lękiem...]]></entry>

    <entry id="journal_page_text_26"><![CDATA[Leżę pośród ciał i fragmentów wraku. Moje ramię jest przygwożdżone. Spomiędzy skał wyłania się naraz wąż, smakując powietrze swym rozdwojonym językiem. Jego kły spadają na mnie niczym uderzenie gromu. Jad toczy niespiesznie me ciało. Ścina żyły mrozem i pnie się w górę ramienia, popychając mnie na ścieżkę, z której nie ma odwrotu.]]></entry>

    <entry id="journal_page_text_27"><![CDATA[Ostrze jest tępe, a ja mam mało czasu. W spazmach trwogi siekam, rzezam, dźgam. Moje wrzaski niosą się echem po obojętnych wydmach. Cichną w chłodzie pustynnego wiatru. Giną w niemym blasku księżyca. Poświęcam swe piękno na ołtarzu przetrwania. Opłacam swą przyszłość jedyną monetą, która kiedykolwiek była prawdziwie moja.]]></entry>

    <entry id="journal_page_text_28"><![CDATA[Spoglądam na mą oderżniętą dłoń. Patrzę na pniak mego skrwawionego ramienia. Nie będzie już pożądliwych spojrzeń tłumu, ni monet rzucanych u mych stóp. Bezgłośnie wypowiadam słowa podziękowania dla mego wybawcy, gdy ten znika pośród cieni. Wreszcie opuściłam mą złotą klatkę. I naraz rozumiem: droga do prawdziwego piękna prowadzi poprzez upadek.]]></entry>

    <entry id="journal_page_text_29"><![CDATA[(The journal entry is written in a very fine and elegant cursive) To whomever may be the reader. This is a private journal. Please refrain from reading any further and return this item to its rightful owner. You may find me using the map provided. Thank you. Signed, Euryale (Attached is a detailed map of the Hamlet. However, the directions given have been smudged and are unreadable)]]></entry>

    <entry id="journal_page_text_30"><![CDATA[(The journal entry is written in a very fine and elegant cursive) It's been quite some time since I've stepped foot in this grand city. Much has changed in my absence. The miserly workers had been replaced with cheerful men and women talking of the most recent battles in the king's arena. They also talk of a valiant champion who will be fighting in the arena later in the day. I tried to brush off the chatter but as I wandered about, all I heard was more and more of this man's heroic feats. With my interest peaked, I'll be making my way to the gladiatorial ring soon.]]></entry>

    <entry id="journal_page_text_31"><![CDATA[(The journal entry is written in a very fine and elegant cursive) Typical. I took a wrong turn on my way to the arena and ended up in a rather droll part of the city which served as a home to many vulgar and unscrupulous individuals. It was only predictable that I would be stopped by a group of these thugs looking to strip me of my belongings. A rather poor choice of words and hands that touched places they shouldn't have resulted in an unpleasant series of events that took up more of my time than I had hoped. The praised hero would begin his fight soon so I hastily picked up my mirror and made my way to the coliseum.]]></entry>

    <entry id="journal_page_text_32"><![CDATA[(The journal entry is written in a very fine and elegant cursive) I just barely made it in time for the battle. Luckily one of the guards was kind enough to procure me a seat where I could best spectate the skirmish. As the gates opened, a single man emerged and I sat amongst the crowd in awe.]]></entry>

    <entry id="journal_page_text_33"><![CDATA[(The journal entry is written in a very fine and elegant cursive) The audience cheered in excitement. The warrior was the physical embodiment of perfection. His chiseled body told of a man who had seen rigorous battles while his long flowing hair would have many believe he was born from the gods. In one hand he held a fisherman's net and in the other an ornate trident. He was so perfect that I had reason to believe he had attained his beauty through obscure means, just as I had.]]></entry>

    <entry id="journal_page_text_34"><![CDATA[(The journal entry is written in a very fine and elegant cursive) Amongst the crowd's cheering admiration, the hero's adversary appeared. On the opposite side of the arena, a rusted gate opened and what emerged was a behemoth pulled in chains by beastmasters. It was a creature from a children's tale. A hulking monster covered in iron spikes and decorated with scars. The citizens greeted this thing with mocking shouts and vulgar insults. Despite this menacing beast, the champion did not show an ounce of fear, but instead smirked with confidence.]]></entry>

    <entry id="journal_page_text_35"><![CDATA[(The journal entry is written in a very fine and elegant cursive) The beastmasters released their chains and the battle began. At first I had my doubts. The monster was the size of ten men and shook the earth with every step. How could any man possibly hope to defeat such a thing? But to my surprise, the hero was succeeding. The fight looked more like a dance, with the agile warrior dodging the ogre's clumsy strikes. He stabbed at it with masterful precision and weaved around the behemoth as it mindlessly swung its boulder fists around in frustration.]]></entry>

    <entry id="journal_page_text_36"><![CDATA[(The journal entry is written in a very fine and elegant cursive) In a spectacular display, the champion thrusted his trident into the heart of the beast, causing blood to spill forth and sending the crowd into a raucous frenzy. With a loud thud, the creature collapsed and its defiling blood soaked the soil around it. The crowd continued to cheer and applaud as the hero took in their admiration. He bravely walked to the massive corpse and planted one foot on top of its metallic head. He waved to the crowd and I could have sworn he had turned to me and winked. My heart skipped a beat.]]></entry>

    <entry id="journal_page_text_37"><![CDATA[(The journal entry is written in a very fine and elegant cursive) It all happened so quickly. Our admiration quickly turned to horror as the beast revealed that it was still alive. The creature caught the hero's leg in an iron grip. It pulled the man to the ground and, with its other fist, it slammed down on the champion's face. A single scream was all we heard as the behemoth smashed the man's head and splattered bits of him all around. It slowly stood back up, covered in the gore of its victim. A moment of shock soon shifted to panic and anguish as the torn crowd began to demand justice.]]></entry>

    <entry id="journal_page_text_38"><![CDATA[(The journal entry is written in a very fine and elegant cursive) The crowd entered a vengeful frenzy as they shouted for the guards. I quickly took my leave and the last thing I saw was the beast running rampant on the beastmasters that tried to subdue it. Even as I hastily made my way out of the amphitheater's gates, I could still hear the frantic shouts of the crowd and the trembling of the earth itself. It had been interesting returning to my city of origin, but I sense a riot will soon break out and I plan to depart long before it has any effect on me.]]></entry>

    <entry id="journal_page_text_39"><![CDATA[Mówiono mi, że prowadzenie dziennika może pomóc odciągnąć moje myśli od niepokojącego strachu, którego to miejsce przyprawia, więc mogę zacząć i teraz. Zlecono nam skatalogowanie części kniei, miejsca, które przynosi wiele nieprzyjemnych wspomnień, ale o tym wiem lepiej niż ktokolwiek inny. Towarzyszyć mi będą Turid i Aldwin. Podczas gdy Turid zdarza się być zdruzgotany, a Aldwin lekkomyślny, stanowią skuteczną i niezawodną załogę. Przydzielono nam także nową twarz, która mnie dręczy...]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_40"><![CDATA[ Ledwo rozpoczęliśmy naszą misję, a ja już mam złe przeczucie. Niecała godzina od wymarszu a "nowa krew" już narzeka. Za dużo chodzenia, mówi, za dużo brudu, mówi. Najgorsze jest to, że na ekspedycję ubrała się w ekstrawagancką szatę, trzymając przy tym złamane lustro. Jaki jest sens w tak dziwnym stroju? Mówi, że jest "wygodne". Nigdy nie zrozumiem mieszkańców miast...]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_41"><![CDATA[Nasze pierwsze spotkanie w tym ohydnym miejscu niemal zakończyło się katastrofą, jednakże świeżak wyciągnął nas z kłopotu. Okazuje się, że jest jakąś czarownicą. Korzystającą z jej złamanego lustra wyczarowała uzdrawiającą magię. Sprawiła, że Turid wrócił do pełni sił po tym, gdy został dźgnięty przez jakiegoś kultystę. Aldwin podjął sympatię wobec niej, ale u mnie wzrosła tylko moja nieufność...]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_42"><![CDATA[Wszystko idzie jak po maśle. Siadam i piszę to, podczas odpoczynku przy ognisku. Wiedźma wymienia się komplementami z Turidem, gadka szmatka, której nigdy nie zrozumiem. Muszę przyznać, nawet jak na dziewczę wychowane w mieście, jest niezwykle piękna... Nieskazitelna skóra, kojący głos. Jedyną złą rzeczą jest to jej to cholerne lustro. Strzaskane i podrapane, jakby było starsze od niej samej. Bardzo dziwne...]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_43"><![CDATA[Cholerni bandyci przyczaili się na nas w nocy. Różnili się od tych, z którymi podróżowałam, jednakże ich zachowanie było takie samo. Biedny Aldwin był pierwszą ofiarą. Jeden z tych bydlaków dźgnął go prosto w brzuch i otworzył mu wnętrzności. Zmarł, leżąc w kałuży własnej krwi. Zanim zdążyłam nawet złapać mój łuk, jeden z nich postrzelił mnie w ramię. Przez tę przeklętą ranę, nie byłam nawet w stanie się podnieść a co dopiero walczyć. Ruszyli na czarownicę. Biedna dopiero co się wybudziła. Myślałam, że to będzie dla niej koniec, ale bardziej mylić się nie mogłam.]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_44"><![CDATA[Przeklęta czarownica upuściła swoje lustro, odsłaniając swoją paskudną postać. Gmatwanina macek, paszcz i kolców, skrzecząca na swoich niedoszłych napastników. Turid krzycząc, uciekał tylko jak najdalej od tego czegoś. Kiedy jeden z bandytów wziął rozmach ku potworowi, ten poruszył się z niemożliwą prędkością i zwymiotował zgniłą żółcią z wielu swoich ust. Biedny głupiec krzyczał w agonii, gdy jego ciało spływało z kości, aż pozostała sama kałuża wrzącej krwi. To wystarczyło, aby  reszta grupy uciekła jak najdalej, podczas gdy potworność odwróciła wzrok do mnie. Czysty instynkt rozkazywał mi biec tak szybko, jak tylko mogę w ciemność...]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_45"><![CDATA[Rana jest zakażona. Mam halucynacje. Mój cholerny ptak odleciał podczas tego okropnego spotkania i nie wrócił. Mogę tylko zakładać, że Turida spotkał ten sam los co Aldwina. Wyobrażając sobie, że jak to się skończy,  kuliłam się pod drzewem nawiedzana wspomnieniami niewyobrażalnego stworzenia. Myślałam, że moje grzechy zostaną odkupione…, ale zamiast tego umieram zapomniana tak jak wiele innych, niezliczonych dusz. Sądziłam, że jestem gotowa do walki z okropnościami..., ale teraz wszystko jest jasne...]]></entry>

    <entry id="journal_page_text_53"><![CDATA[I tracked my latest hunt to the grand city. This one will be illusive, its behaviour suggests that it prefers manipulation over direct confrontation. It'll be difficult to identify the creature, given the degeneracy of this city's populace, but I will not give up my search. The Light guides me.]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_54"><![CDATA[I've found the hag. I over-estimated its intelligence, it had made itself easy to find based on its arrogant nature and abhorrent flaunting. I've announced its debaucheries to the entirety of the city populace and the hunt will soon begin.]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_55"><![CDATA[The creature fled into the foul shantytowns that sit in the city's shadow. I cannot allow such a thing to exist, so I set the entirety of the corrupted dwellings ablaze. With nowhere to run, it will surely burn for its sins.]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_56"><![CDATA[Many charred corpses were found amongst the aftermath. They are unrecognizable but I am sure that the witch can be included among them. Despite my radical actions, the cityfolk do not seem to care for those lost in the fire. Surely they must understand as I do that the loss of these peasants is a small price to pay for the eradication of evil. And so, with another monster put down for good, I continue my crusade against corruption.]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_57"><![CDATA[This will surely mark me down in the manuscripts as a hero of the Light! We have captured the heretical witch that had splintered our faith. I will be responsible for her execution, and there is no punishment more fitting for a false prophet than death by holy fire.]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_58"><![CDATA[To see the witch with my own eyes is to know pure corruption. There is no doubt that this thing is responsible for splitting the faithful followers of the Light into conflicted factions. It speaks as if it is a disciple of the Light like us, but I see through her ruse. I will commence the burning shortly.]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_59"><![CDATA[It is an abomination unlike any I've encountered! It extinguished the sanctioned fires of the pyre with ease and presented itself as an avatar of the Flame. It had converted all around me to its falsified fate and I watched in horror as both peasants and crusaders of the Light bowed in unison to this creature of debased prophecies. I retreated from its deformed presence, and now I must warn those that are still pure of its corrupting nature.]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_60"><![CDATA[The worst thing has come to reality. The creature proved too strong, and now all have come to worship it as a demigod. I have been excommunicated from what was once a faith that fought the darkness but now is a cult praising a thing that mockingly resembles an angel. Even in the face of defeat, I will not stop my hunt. This thing must die, or mankind will be damned for eternity.]]></entry>

    <entry id="journal_page_text_61"><![CDATA[Nasz plan jest w realizacji. Nie będziemy dłużej najsłabszym z królestw. Morskie potwory z zachodu, a także podżegacze z północy będą się nas bać. Będą wiedzieć, że jesteśmy prawowitymi władcami tej ziemi. Jesteśmy doskonałymi istotami, a naszym przeznaczeniem jest rządzenie wszystkimi.]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_62"><![CDATA[Piękno można znaleźć w najbardziej nieodpowiednich do tego miejscach. Podczas naszych wędrówek przez wiejskie krajobrazy natknęliśmy się na dwa doskonałe kwiaty. Są niczym lustrzane kopie, przepełnione pięknem i wdziękiem. Nie należy zostawiać czegoś tak cennego pośród brudu zwykłych ludzi, więc zabraliśmy je. Będą one kwintesencją naszego planu.]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_63"><![CDATA[Szybko przyjęli nasze zwyczaje. Są legendą zrodzoną w ludzkich ciałach. Bliźniacze Kwiaty, jeden wyspecjalizowany w wojnie, drugi w dyplomacji. Ich technika jest bezbłędna, doskonała, chętnie obserwujemy, jak uczniowie podążają ich drogami. Nasza armia szybko się formuje. W ciągu kilku lat będziemy mieli armię doskonałych wojowników, wytrenowanych przez podwójne ucieleśnienie doskonałości.]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_64"><![CDATA[Minęły miesiące rygorystycznego treningu, ale zaczynamy dostrzegać rezultaty. Bliźniacze Kwiaty szkolą naszych śmiertelnych żołnierzy na bogobojnych fanatyków. Wojowniczka jest surowa i wybiórcza, trenuje tylko młodych mężczyzn ze skórą równie bezbłędną, jak jej sama. Mówi, że jej technika musi równać się pozaziemskiemu pięknu. Nie wątpimy w nią, bo przecież nie możemy stawać na równi z lekcjami tak doskonałej istoty. Wielu żołnierzy padło od intensywnego treningu, ale wiemy, że ci, którzy przeżyją i wytrwają, wzniosą się i pokonają naszych wrogów.]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_65"><![CDATA[Ten plan był realizowany przez dziesiątki lat, w końcu jednak można zebrać owoce naszej pracy! Pierwszy występ Bliźniaczych Kwiatów był wspaniały. Północne królestwo nie mogło powstrzymać naszego ataku. Wojowniczka była tak samo piękna, jak i pełna wdzięku. Tańczyła na polu bitwy, malując ziemię krwią naszych wrogów, a nasi doskonali żołnierze podążali jej ścieżką. Nasza bezbłędna armia zatriumfowała tego dnia i będzie triumfować jeszcze wiele razy. Nasi wrogowie nareszcie poznają strach i pokłonią się nam, gdy przyjdzie na to czas. Przygotowujemy się do świętowania, dzisiejsza noc zostanie nocą zapamiętaną na zawsze.]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_66"><![CDATA[Straszliwa tragedia spotkała nas. Bliźniaczych Kwiatów już nie ma. Jedno z Kwiatów znaleziono otoczone trupami naszych najlepszych wojowników, było gołe i leżało w kałuży własnej krwi. Drugiego Kwiatu nigdzie nie było. Mściwe przekleństwa przesiąknęły cały pokój, z pewnością niektóre czary należały do naszego najbardziej znienawidzonego wroga. Wiedzieli, że nie mogą bezpośrednio z nami walczyć, więc wysłali infiltratorów, żeby nas zabili w najbardziej wrażliwym dla nas momencie. To nie będzie nasz koniec. Znajdziemy zagubiony kwiat i odbudujemy naszą armię.]]></entry>

    <entry id="journal_page_text_67"><![CDATA[Cholera, uciekła jedna z dziewcząt. Ascot musiał źle związać węzły, a teraz dziewucha przez tego idiotę, jest w lesie. Matka wysyła mnie z Jarretem i Mavisem, żebyśmy ją wytropili. Jakoś mnie to nie dziwi. Mój dzień zrujnowany przez działania martwego mózgu przygłupa. Może, gdy przemówię do niego pięścią, nauczy się myśleć.]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_68"><![CDATA[Znaleźliśmy dziewkę, ale Jarret i Mavis tak wciągnęli się w polowanie, że ją zabili. Rozdrażnili mnie. Natychmiast wróciłam do matki, aby jej powiedzieć. Była wściekła. Jak tylko Jarret i Mavis wrócili, zebrała większość bandy, aby dać żywą lekcję. "Życie za życie", zawsze mawiała. Oboje mieli walczylć na śmierć i życię. Finalnie zabili się nawzajem. Jarret rozciął wnętrzności Mavisa, podczas gdy tamten zmiażdżył mu czaszkę. Makabryczna scena, ale dwóch debili mniej, z którymi musiałabym przebywać.]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_69"><![CDATA[Zostałam wysłana przez matkę na kolejne polowanie. Tym razem zgarniamy jedną z tych "egzotycznych" kobiet wschodu. Mają wkrótce tędy przejeżdżać i ja jestem odpowiedzialna za śledzenie karawany. Nadchodzi ten bezużyteczny karaluch Ascot. Jest tylko zbędnym balastem. Przynajmniej będzie dobrym pożywieniem.]]></entry>	
    <entry id="journal_page_text_70"><![CDATA[Złapaliśmy dziewczynę, ale ogromnym kosztem. Cholerni strażnicy używali jakiejś obcej techniki walki. Czegoś takiego jeszcze, nigdy nie widziałam. Wzięli nas z zaskoczenia, ale my mieliśmy przewagę liczebną. Ascot zginął w zasadzce, to chyba jedyna dobra rzecz jaką ta potyczka przyniosła. Ta przeklęta dziewucha nie mówi nic z sensem, rozmawia w obcym języku. Musiałam nauczyć ją spokoju. Mam nadzieję, że jest więcej warta, niż to co zwykle matka otrzymuje. Za dużo roboty jak na jeden dzień, a to wprowadza mnie w jeszcze gorszy nastrój.]]></entry>

    <entry id="journal_page_text_72"><![CDATA[Ta dziwkarska okazja dla ludzi. Ta wąsko-oka lalunia złapał mój cholerny kaptur. Potraktowałam polik tej nieposłusznej dziwki solidnym uderzeniem. Dostała w twarz z taką siłą, że aż straciła równowagę i uderzyła swoją główką o kant stół. Teraz jej krew jest na moich rękach, a matka chce zemsty. Uciekłam tak szybko, jak mogłam. Nie zginę z powodu jakiejś małej szmaty.]]></entry>	
    <entry id="journal_page_text_73"><![CDATA[Minęły tygodnie, może nawet miesiące. Straciłam rachubę od czasu kiedy pierwsza grupa łowców mnie znalazła. Ta oszalała wiedźma nigdy nie zapomina o urazie. "Życie za życie." Nic tylko obłąkana bzdura od tej wariatki. Nigdy nie wierzyłam w jej kazania, byłam tam po prostu dla zysku. Teraz wysyła coraz więcej zbirów, żeby wziąć moją głowę. Jestem lepsza od nich wszystkich. Liczba moich zabójstw jest tak pokaźna, że powinna dać do myślenia, a jednak cały czas rośnie przy każdym ryzykownym starciu.]]></entry>	
    <entry id="journal_page_text_74"><![CDATA[To jest męczące. Ta psychopatka wciąż wysyła, coraz większe grupy, żeby mnie dopadły. Nie mogę tak żyć, w ciągłym niebezpieczeństwie kolejnej zasadzki. Nadszedł czas, aby znaleźć miejsce do ukrycia. Może życie jako najemnik dla szlacheckiej rodziny wystarczy. Najlepsze jest to, że ci nadęci głupcy umrą zamiast mnie, gdy w końcu nadejdzie czas...]]></entry>

    <entry id="journal_page_text_75"><![CDATA[(Strona jest zatarta i ledwo da się odczytać) Zarżnęli wszystkich mężczyzn. Mojego męża, mego brata, nawet mojego własnego syna. Czekaliśmy razem, związani, gotowi na jakikolwiek okrutny los, który mogli nam zgotować. To handlarze niewolników. Już wcześniej słyszeliśmy co zrobili sąsiednim klanom, a teraz my staliśmy się ich ofiarami. Modlę się o szybki ratunek. Nie potrafię sobie wyobrazić co się ze mną stanie w tym piekielnym miejscu.]]></entry>	
    <entry id="journal_page_text_76"><![CDATA[(Strona jest zatarta i ledwo da się odczytać) Traktują nas gorzej niż bydło. Dostajemy resztki do jedzenia i zostawiają nas w brudzie Kobiety, które nie zostały sprzedane, są tutaj ze mną, gnijąc na uboczu i pragnąc śmierci. Ptactwo otacza nas, chętne do pożywienia się naszymi żałosnymi ciałami, ale ja czuję z nimi więź. Pytają mnie o ofiarę, w zamian za wolność. Chcą wiedzieć co jestem w stanie im zaoferować. Pozostali krzyczą i kopią ptaki, ale ja pozwalam im się zbliżać. Pragną pożywić się mym ramieniem, oferując za to poluzowanie więzów. Zgadzam się.]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_77"><![CDATA[(Strona jest zatarta i ledwo da się odczytać) Po wyswobodzeniu się, nie uwolniłam pozostałych. Odmówili darów stada i nie zasługują na błogosławieństwa, którymi zostałam obdarzona. Zostawiłam za sobą stosy trupów, idąc do przywódcy handlarzy niewolników - pierwszego z wielu darów dla mojej nowo założonej rodziny. Kiedy wreszcie go znalazła, nie zawahałam się wydłubać mu oczy i uczynić go największą ofiarą na pierwszej uczcie mojego stada.]]></entry>

Zostańcie i bądźcie częścią naszego stada albo odejdźcie i bądźcie jego ofiarami. Wielu odeszło i tych uczyniliśmy przykładem. Tym, którzy zostali powiedziałam jasno na czym stoimy. Krąg życia i śmierci, tylko on się liczy. Życie za życie - taki jest koszt pogwałcenia zasad. Każda śmierć jest ofiarą i tak długo jak ta jedna reguła jest przestrzegana, tak długo będę akceptowała ich sposoby życia. Zostaniemy pasterzami dla słabych, a ci, którzy okażą się niegodni staną się darem dla naszego stada.]]></entry>

Поэтому меня заставляют танцевать для ценителей таких зрелищ с безнадежными пыльными лицами, со слезящимися и налитыми кровью глазами, с ухмылками на потрескавшихся губах. Для этих порочных мерзавцев я не человек, а экзотический цветок. Я прекрасное создание.]]></entry>

И вот мои руки связаны, а я сижу в повозке караванщика рядом с золотыми идолами и украшенными самоцветами статуями. Все мы – бесценные редкости, которые подлежат передаче в казну визиря.

С привычной ловкостью я сбрасываю веревки с запястий и выскакиваю наружу. Охранник кричит, лошади пугаются, повозка кренится…]]></entry>

Из-под камня бесшумно появляется змея, ее раздвоенный язык пробует воздух на вкус. Змея кусает молниеносно, ее яд действует медленно. Холод постепенно растекается по руке, вынуждая меня сделать ужасный выбор.]]></entry>

Мои крики растворяются в равнодушной тишине барханов, леденящем ветре пустыни, холодном свете луны. Я жертвую своей красотой в надежде выжить; я плачу за свое будущее, отдавая единственное, что у меня есть.]]></entry>

Пожалуйста, воздержитесь от дальнейшего чтения и верните его законному владельцу. Вы можете найти меня, используя предоставленную карту. Спасибо. Подпись, Эвриала. (Прилагается подробная карта города. Однако указанные данные размыты и нечитаемы)]]></entry>

		<entry id="journal_page_text_30"><![CDATA[(Запись в дневнике написана очень тонким и красивым почерком) Прошло довольно много времени с тех пор, как моя нога ступала в этом великом городе. В мое отсутствие многое изменилось. Скудные рабочие сменились веселыми мужчинами и женщинами, говорящими о последних битвах на арене короля. Они также говорили о доблестном чемпиона, который будет сражаться на арене позже в тот же день. Я попыталась отбросить болтовню, но, когда я бродил, я все больше и больше слышала о героических подвигов этого человека. Меня это заинтриговало, и я решила пойти на гладиаторскую арену.]]></entry>

		<entry id="journal_page_text_31"><![CDATA[(Запись в дневнике написана очень тонким и красивым почерком) Типичный. Я ошиблась с выбором дороги до арены. Я оказалась в довольно густой части города, которая служила домом для многих вульгарных и бессовестных людей. Было предсказуемо, что меня остановит группа головорезов, которые хотели отобрать мои вещей. Плохой выбор слов и прикасновение рук мест, которые они не должны были, привило к неприятной череде событий, занявшое куда больше моего времени, чем я надеялась. Прославленный герой скоро начнет свой бой, поэтому я поспешно подняла свое зеркало и направилась в Колизей.]]></entry>

		<entry id="journal_page_text_32"><![CDATA[(Запись в дневнике написана очень тонким и красивым почерком) Я едва успел вовремя до начала битвы. К счастью, один из охранников был достаточно любезен, чтобы уступить мне место, где я могла лучше всего увидеть схватку. Когда открылись ворота, появился человек, и я с трепетом сидела среди толпы.]]></entry>

		<entry id="journal_page_text_33"><![CDATA[(Запись в дневнике написана очень тонким и красивым почерком) Зрители приветствовали с волнением. Воин был физическим воплощением совершенства. Его рельефное тело говорило о человеке, который видел много жестких боев, в то время как его длинные распущенные волосы развивались на ветру многие посчитаю, что он был рожден богами. В одной руке он держал сеть рыбака, а в другом - богато украшенный трезубец. Он был настолько совершенен, что у меня были основания полагать, что он достиг своей красоты темными способами, как и я.]]></entry>

		<entry id="journal_page_text_34"><![CDATA[(Запись в дневнике написана очень тонким и красивым почерком) Среди ликующего возгласа толпы, появился противник героя. На противоположной стороне арены открылись ржавые ворота, и возникший в них был чудовищем, вытянутый цепями укроителями. Он бы похож на создание из детских сказок. Ужасный монстр, покрытый железными шипами и украшенный шрамами. Граждане приветствовали его насмешливыми криками и вульгарными оскорблениями. Несмотря на угрожающей вид зверя, чемпион не проявил ни капли страха, а вместо этого с уверенностью ухмыльнулся.]]></entry>

		<entry id="journal_page_text_35"><![CDATA[(Запись в дневнике написана очень тонким и красивым почерком) Укротители выпустили свои цепи, и началась битва. Сначала у меня были сомнения. Монстр был размером с десять человек и сотрясал землю с каждым своим шагом. Как может человек надеется победить его? Но, к моему удивлению, герой преуспел. Бой выглядел скорее как танец, с гибким воином, уклоняющимся от неуклюжих ударов огра. Он ударил его с мастерской точностью и кружил вокруг чудовища, так что начал он бездумно махал своими кулаками-валунами в отчаянии.]]></entry>

		<entry id="journal_page_text_36"><![CDATA[(Запись в дневнике написана очень тонким и красивым почерком) В впечатляющее зрелище, чемпион вонзил свой трезубец в сердце зверя, в результате чего пошла кровь и привело толпу в хриплое безумие. С громким грохотом, существо рухнуло, и его оскверненная кровь пропитала почву вокруг него. Толпа продолжала приветствовать и аплодировать герою. Он смело подошел к массивному трупу и поставил одну ногу на металлическую голову. Он помахал толпе, и я могу поклясться, что он повернулся ко мне и подмигнул. Мое сердце екнуло.]]></entry>

		<entry id="journal_page_text_37"><![CDATA[(Запись в дневнике написана очень тонким и красивым почерком) Все произошло так быстро. Наше восхищение быстро сменилось ужасом, когда зверь показал, что он был еще жив. Существо схватило за ногу героя железной хваткой. Одной рукой он вытащил человека на землю, а другой - ударил по лицу чемпиона. Единственный резкий звук - это все, что мы слышали, когда чудовище размозжило голову мужчины и разбросало его вокруг. Он медленно встал, покрытый кровью жертвы. Момент шока вскоре перешел в панику и тоску, когда разбушевавшееся толпа стала требовать справедливости.]]></entry>

		<entry id="journal_page_text_38"><![CDATA[(Запись в дневнике написана очень тонким и красивым почерком) Толпа вошла мстительное безумство, когда они кричали на охранников. Я быстро откланялась и последняя вещь, которую я видел, был зверь, который возвышался над укротителями, которые пытались покорить его. Даже когда я поспешно вышела из ворот амфитеатра, я все еще слышала безумные крики толпы и дрожь самой земли. Было бв интересно вернуться в мой родной город, но я чувствую, что скоро разразиться бунт, и я планирую уйти задолго до того, как это коснеться на меня.]]></entry>

		<entry id="journal_page_text_39"><![CDATA[Мне посоветовали вести записи, чтобы уберечь свой разум от гнетущего чувства страха в этом убогом месте, так что этим я и займусь. Нам поручили исследовать небольшую область в чаще, место, которое приносит мне много неприятных воспоминаний, но которое я знаю лучше, чем кто-либо еще. Со мной будут Турид и Олдвин. Турид бывает заносчивым, а Олдвин безрассудным, но это все еще эффективный отряд, на который можно положитьск. Также к нам приставили еще одно лицо, которое меня беспокоит...]]></entry>
		<entry id="journal_page_text_40"><![CDATA[Мы только вышли на нашу миссию, а у меня уже плохое предчувствие. Не прошло и часа с момента отбытия, как наш неофит, которого к нам привязали, уже жалуется. То она устала идти, то слишком грязно. Но худшее во всем этом, это то, что она пошла на задание в цветастом платье и с разбитым зеркалом. Какой в этом смысл? Она говорит что оно очень практичное. Никогда не пойму городских...]]></entry>
		<entry id="journal_page_text_41"><![CDATA[Первая стычка в этом убогом месте чуть не закончилась трагедией, но наша новенькая вытянула нас. Оказалось что она какая-то ведьма, и используя свое зеркало, творила им исцеляющую магию. Вытянула Турида с того света, когда тот пропустил удар от культиста. Олдвину она начала нравиться, но мои подозрения только растут...]]></entry>
		<entry id="journal_page_text_42"><![CDATA[Все идет довольно гладко. Пишу это, пока мы разбили лагерь для привала. Ведьма и Турид обмениваются комплиментами. Эту чушь мне никогда не понять. Но должна отметить, для городской девицы, выращенной в городе, она необычайно красива. Безупречная кожа и успокаивающий голос. Единственное, что с ней не так, это ее чертово зеркало. Изношенное и побитое, как будто оно старее чем она сама. Странно...]]></entry>
		<entry id="journal_page_text_43"><![CDATA[Проклятые разбойники застали нас врасплох пока мы спали. Сильно отличаются от тех, с которыми работала я, но повадки все те же. Бедняга Олдвин стал первой жертвой, когда один из этих подонков вспорол его живот. Он умирал лежа в луже собственной крови. Прежде чем я смогла дотянуться до своего лука, один из их стрелков прострелил мне руку. В таком состоянии от меня не будет никакого проку. Они направились прямо к ведьме, которая только-только открыла глаза. Я думала ей пришел конец. Но как же я ошибалась...]]></entry>
		<entry id="journal_page_text_44"><![CDATA[Проклятая ведьма бросила своё зеркало и раскрыла свой отвратительный образ. Месиво из щупалец, пастей и слюны, визжащая на своих обидчиков. Турид пустился в бегство от одного лишь ее вида. Когда один из головорезов замахнулся на это существо, оно приблизилось к ним с невероятной скоростью, и облила их своей гнилостной рвотной желчью со всех своих ртов. Эти несчастные дураки кричали в агонии, когда их плоть слезала с костей, пока от них не осталось только кипящей лужи крови. Этого хватило, чтобы обратить всю шайку воров в бегство, и в этот момент создание обратило свой взглкд на меня. В этот момент все мои инстинкты забили тревогу и я побежала так быстро, как только могла в кромешную тьму...]]></entry>
		<entry id="journal_page_text_45"><![CDATA[Рана заражена, я начала видеть галлюцинации. Моя чертова птица улетела во время этой ужасающей резни и до сих пор не вернулась. Я могу только предполагать, что Турида постигла та же участь, что и Олдвина. Кто бы мог подумать, что это закончится так, прижавшись под деревом, преследуемая воспоминаниями об этом невообразимом чудовище. Я надеялась что смогу искупить свои грехи, но в итоге я умираю, забытая всеми, как и бесчисленные души до меня. Я думала что готова встретить эти ужасы, но теперь к знаю что ошибалась...]]></entry>

		<entry id="journal_page_text_53"><![CDATA[I tracked my latest hunt to the grand city. This one will be illusive, its behaviour suggests that it prefers manipulation over direct confrontation. It'll be difficult to identify the creature, given the degeneracy of this city's populace, but I will not give up my search. The Light guides me.]]></entry>
		<entry id="journal_page_text_54"><![CDATA[I've found the hag. I over-estimated its intelligence, it had made itself easy to find based on its arrogant nature and abhorrent flaunting. I've announced its debaucheries to the entirety of the city populace and the hunt will soon begin.]]></entry>
		<entry id="journal_page_text_55"><![CDATA[The creature fled into the foul shantytowns that sit in the city's shadow. I cannot allow such a thing to exist, so I set the entirety of the corrupted dwellings ablaze. With nowhere to run, it will surely burn for its sins.]]></entry>
		<entry id="journal_page_text_56"><![CDATA[Many charred corpses were found amongst the aftermath. They are unrecognizable but I am sure that the witch can be included among them. Despite my radical actions, the cityfolk do not seem to care for those lost in the fire. Surely they must understand as I do that the loss of these peasants is a small price to pay for the eradication of evil. And so, with another monster put down for good, I continue my crusade against corruption.]]></entry>
		<entry id="journal_page_text_57"><![CDATA[This will surely mark me down in the manuscripts as a hero of the Light! We have captured the heretical witch that had splintered our faith. I will be responsible for her execution, and there is no punishment more fitting for a false prophet than death by holy fire.]]></entry>
		<entry id="journal_page_text_58"><![CDATA[To see the witch with my own eyes is to know pure corruption. There is no doubt that this thing is responsible for splitting the faithful followers of the Light into conflicted factions. It speaks as if it is a disciple of the Light like us, but I see through her ruse. I will commence the burning shortly.]]></entry>
		<entry id="journal_page_text_59"><![CDATA[It is an abomination unlike any I've encountered! It extinguished the sanctioned fires of the pyre with ease and presented itself as an avatar of the Flame. It had converted all around me to its falsified fate and I watched in horror as both peasants and crusaders of the Light bowed in unison to this creature of debased prophecies. I retreated from its deformed presence, and now I must warn those that are still pure of its corrupting nature.]]></entry>
		<entry id="journal_page_text_60"><![CDATA[The worst thing has come to reality. The creature proved too strong, and now all have come to worship it as a demigod. I have been excommunicated from what was once a faith that fought the darkness but now is a cult praising a thing that mockingly resembles an angel. Even in the face of defeat, I will not stop my hunt. This thing must die, or mankind will be damned for eternity.]]></entry>

They will know that we are the rightful rulers of this land. We are perfect beings, so it is our destiny to rule over all.]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_62"><![CDATA[Beauty can be found in the most unlikely of places. On our travels through the peasant countryside, we stumbled upon two perfect flowers. Mirror copies of each other, with unnatural beauty and poise. It is not right to leave something so precious in the filth of the common people, so we took them in. They will be a quintessential piece to our plan.]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_63"><![CDATA[They took quickly to our ways. They are a legend born in flesh. The Twin Flowers, one that trains in war, another that trains in diplomacy. Their technique is flawless, perfected, and we are eager to see disciples follow their ways. Our army forms quickly. Within years, we will have an army of perfect warriors, trained by the dual embodiment of perfection.]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_64"><![CDATA[It has been months of rigorous training, but we are beginning to see results. The Twin Flowers are training our mortal soldiers into godly disciples. The Warrior is a strict, selective, only training young men with skin as flawless as hers. She says that her technique must be matched with unearthly beauty. We do not doubt her, for we cannot begin to comprehend the lessons of a perfect being. Many soldiers have fallen from the intense training, but we know that those that survive and persevere will ascend, and vanquish our foes.]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_65"><![CDATA[This plan was decades in the making, and finally the fruits of our labor can be harvested! The Twin Flowers’ first performance was grandeur. The north kingdom could not withstand our assault. The Warrior was as graceful as she is beautiful. Dancing across the battlefield, painting the dirt with our foes’ blood as our perfect soldiers followed in her path. Our flawless army triumphed this day and they will triumph for many more. Our enemies will finally know fear, and they will bow to us in time. We prepare for celebration, tonight will be a night remembered forever.]]></entry>

One was found, surrounded by the corpses of our finest warriors, naked and splayed out in a pool of her own blood. The other Flower was nowhere to be found. Spiteful maledictions were posted all around the room, surely some sorcery by our most hated enemy. They knew they couldn’t fight us directly, so they sent infiltrators to kill us when we were most vulnerable. This will not be our end. We will find the lost flower, and we will rebuild our army. ]]></entry>

    <entry id="journal_page_text_67"><![CDATA[Проклятье, одна из девиц сбежала. Должно быть Эскот, бестолочь, плохо её связал и теперь она где-то в лесу. Мать посылает меня с Джарретом и Мэвис выследить её. Ничего удивительного на самом деле. Мой день испорчен безмозглым дурачком. Может я заколю его во сне, когда вернусь, чтобы преподать ему урок.]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_68"><![CDATA[Девку мы нашли, но Джаррет и Мэвис увлеклись охотой и убили её. Как же они бесят. Я тут же вернулась к Матери и рассказала ей об этом. Она была в ярости. Она собрала многих из нас после того, как Джаррет и Мэвис вернулись, чтобы сделать из них показательный пример. "Жизнь за жизнь", как она всегда говорит. Заставила их обоих биться насмерть. Всё закончилось смертью обоих. Джаррету был выпотрошен, у Мэвис раздробило череп. Жёсткая сцена, но теперь на двух придурков меньше, с которыми мне более не придётся возиться.]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_69"><![CDATA[Мать отправила меня на очередную охоту. На этот раз мы возьмем одну из тех “экзотических” женщин с востока. Они скоро пройдут здесь, и я отвечаю за разведку. Этот бесполезный таракан Эскот идет с нами. Он для меня всего лишь обуза. На самый крайний случай он будет хорошей наживкой.]]></entry>	
    <entry id="journal_page_text_70"><![CDATA[Девку мы схватили, но большой ценой. Проклятые стражники использовали какую-то иноземную боевую технику, которую я никогда раньше не видела. Они застали нас врасплох, но мы взяли их числом. Эскот погиб в засаде, единственная хорошая новость. Проклятая девка даже толком внятно не разговаривает, только на каком-то иностранном языке. Пришлось дать ей леща, чтобы притихла. Лучше бы ей стоить того, что за неё получит Мать. Это куда больше работы на один день, чем я предпочла бы, и от этого настроение никакое.]]></entry>	
    <entry id="journal_page_text_71"><![CDATA[Мы привели ее обратно к Матери, и она отправила нас встретиться с заказчиками, которые заказали эту иностранную овцу. Это была кучка дворян. У их главы “нажитый” вкус к импортным товарам и предлагает нам щедрое количество пищи, оружия, брони, всё чего только пожелаем, за эту немощную тварь. Я буду следить за сделкой. ]]></entry>	
    <entry id="journal_page_text_72"><![CDATA[Это лишь нелепое оправдание для скотины. Эта ускоглазая шлюха схватила меня за капюшон. Я сбила ее с ног как шлюху, коей она и является, и она ударилась своей прелестной головкой о стол. Теперь ее кровь на моих руках, и Мать жаждет мести. Я бежала оттуда так быстро, как только могла. Я не сдохну из-за какой-то развратной мелкой шлюхи.]]></entry>	
    <entry id="journal_page_text_73"><![CDATA[Прошли недели, может быть даже месяцы. Я сбилась со счёта времени с тех пор как первые отряды нашли меня. Эта сумасшедшая карга никогда не забудет обиду. "Жизнь за жизнь". Никогда не слышала ничего адекватного от этой ведьмы кроме помешанной чуши. Я никогда не верила в её проповеди, я была с ними только ради собственной выгоды. Теперь она посылает все больше и больше головорезов по мою голову. Я лучше, чем все они. Количество убийств уже должно вселять страх, и оно только растет с каждой смертельной встречей.]]></entry>	
    <entry id="journal_page_text_74"><![CDATA[Это утомительно. Эта психованная гарпия продолжает посылать все больше и больше своих сородичей, чтобы выследить меня. Я не могу так жить, в постоянном страхе перед очередной засадой. Пришло время найти место, где можно спрятаться. Может сгодится жизнь наёмника у знатной семьи. В конце концов лучше бы этим напыщенным глупцам умереть вместо меня, когда придет время...]]></entry>

Они связали нас всех, готовых к любой жестокой участи, которую нам готовят. Они работорговцы. Я слышала о том, что случилось с соседними кланами, и мы стали их следующими жертвами. Молюсь, чтобы нас вскоре спасли, не могу себе представить, что со мной будет в этом адовом месте.]]></entry>	
    <entry id="journal_page_text_76"><![CDATA[(Страница грязная и сложно читаемая) Они относятся к нам хуже, чем к скоту. Нам дана грязь, чтобы питаться и жить в ней. Женщины, которых не продали, здесь со мной, гниют и желают смерти. Нас окружают птицы, жаждущие полакомиться нашими сломленными телами, но я чувствую связь. Они просят жертву в обмен на свободу. Они хотят знать, что я готова отдать. Остальные кричат и пинают их, но я позволяю им приблизиться ко мне. Они просят плоть моей руки, а взамен они ослабят мои оковы. Я согласна.]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_77"><![CDATA[(Страница грязная и сложно читаемая) Освобождённая от оков, я не освободила других. Они отказались от даров стаи и не заслуживают благословения, которые мне даровали. Я прорубила себе путь из трупов, совершив путь к лидеру этих работорговцев, это первое из многих даров, что я сделаю для своей новой семьи. Когда я наконец нашла их лидера, то без колебаний вырвала ему глаза и оставила его в качестве последнего приношения на первый пир моей стаи.]]></entry>	
    <entry id="journal_page_text_78"><![CDATA[(Страница грязная и сложно читаемая) По поводу оставшихся, я дала им простой выбор. Остаться, и стать частью нашей стаи, или отказаться и стать нашими жертвами. Многие отказались, и стали примером для остальных. Для тех, кто остался, я ясно дала понять, за что мы стоим. Круговорот жизни и смерти – единственное, что имеет значение. Жизнь за жизнь – это цена за проступки. Каждая смерть есть жертва, и пока это единственное правило будет соблюдаться, я буду уважать их образ жизни. Мы пастыри для слабых, и те, кого мы сочтём недостойными, станут жертвами для нашей стаи.]]></entry>

La serpiente se asoma silenciosamente detrás de una roca, su lengua saboreando el aire. La mordedura es rápida; el veneno, lento. Corre frío por mis venas, irritándome el brazo, obligándome a tomar una decisión terrible.]]></entry>

Sacrifico mi belleza por una oportunidad de vivir; pago mi futuro con la única moneda que alguna vez he poseído.]]></entry>

Ahora lo entiendo todo: algo no puede ser verdaderamente bello hasta que está roto.]]></entry>

Por favor, absténgase de leer más páginas y devuelva este objeto a su propietaria legítima. Podrá encontrarla usando el mapa adjunto. Se lo agradezco. Firmado: Euryale (Hay un mapa adjunto del feudo muy detallado, sin embargo las direcciones están borrosas y son ilegibles)]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_30"><![CDATA[(La entrada del diario está escrita en una cursiva muy fina y elegante) Ha pasado bastante tiempo desde la última vez que puse pie en esta gran ciudad. Ha cambiado mucho en mi ausencia. Los trabajadores empobrecidos han sido sustituidos por hombres y mujeres entusiastas que hablan de las batallas más recientes en la arena real. También hablan de un valiente campeón que luchará hoy, más tarde. He intentado restar importancia a las conversaciones, pero oigo más y más sobre las heroicas peripecias de este hombre. Con mi interés por las nubes, me dirijo apresuradamente al anillo gladiatorio.]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_31"><![CDATA[(La entrada del diario está escrita en una cursiva muy fina y elegante) Típico. He girado por el camino equivocado y he acabado en una "divertida" parte de la ciudad que sirve de hogar a individuos vulgares y sin escrúpulos. Era predecible que acabaría dándome el alto un grupo de matones deseando quitarme mis pertenencias. Una pobre elección de palabras y toques con las manos en zonas dónde no se debe desencadenaron una serie de eventos que me entretuvieron más tiempo del que hubiera deseado. El aclamado héroe empezaría su combate pronto, así que rápidamente recogí mi espejo y me dirigí al coliseo.]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_32"><![CDATA[(La entrada del diario está escrita en una cursiva muy fina y elegante) Llegué justo a tiempo para presenciar la batalla. Afortunadamente uno de los guardias fue lo suficientemente amable como para dejarme un asiento muy bueno para ver la escaramuza. Mientras se abrían las grandes puertas de hierro, un solo hombre emergió y me senté entre la multitud con asombro.]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_33"><![CDATA[(La entrada del diario está escrita en una cursiva muy fina y elegante) La audiencia vitoreaba excitada. El guerrero era la encarnación física de la perfección. Su cuerpo cincelado delataba a este hombre como alguien que había visto batallas severas mientras que su largo pelo ondeando al viento hacía a muchos creer que era descendiente de los mismos dioses. En una mano sujetaba la red de un pescador y en la otra un tridente ornamentado. Era tan perfecto que pensé que habría obtenido esa belleza a través de las artes oscuras, como yo misma hice tiempo atrás.]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_34"><![CDATA[(La entrada del diario está escrita en una cursiva muy fina y elegante) Entre los vítores de admiración de la multitud, apareció el adversario del héroe. En el lado opuesto de la arena, se abrió una gran puerta de hierro oxidada y emergió un mastodonte sujetado por cadenas por sus domadores. Era una criatura de cuento infantil. Un monstruo descomunal cubierto con pinchos de hierro y repleto de cicatrices. Los ciudadanos le dieron la bienvenida a esta cosa con gritos burlones e insultos vulgares. A pesar de esta bestia amenazante, el campeón no mostraba ni un ápice de miedo, sino que sonreía seguro de sí mismo.]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_35"><![CDATA[(La entrada del diario está escrita en una cursiva muy fina y elegante) Los domadores soltaron las cadenas y comenzó la batalla. Al principio tenía mis dudas. El monstruo era del tamaño de diez hombres y la tierra temblaba con cada uno de sus pasos. ¿Cómo podría cualquier hombre tener esperanza alguna de derrotar a algo así? Pero para mí sorpresa, el héroe iba ganando. El combate parecía un baile, con el ágil guerrero esquivando los torpes ataques de aquel ogro. El héroe lo apuñalaba con una precisión maestra serpenteando a su alrededor; mientras que el mastodonte agitaba sus duros puños frustrado, sin conseguir impactarle.]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_36"><![CDATA[(La entrada del diario está escrita en una cursiva muy fina y elegante) Era una exhibición espectacular, el campeón clavó su tridente en el corazón de la bestia, provocando que la sangre lo salpicara todo y llevando a la multitud a un frenesí de gritos. Con un golpe seco, la criatura colapsó y su turbia sangre empapó el suelo circundante. La multitud continuó aclamando y aplaudió al héroe que tenían en tanta estima. Con valor, anduvo por encima del masivo cadáver y puso un pie encima de su cabeza cubierta con un casco metálico. Saludó con la mano al público y juraría que me miró y me guiñó un ojo. Me dio un vuelco el corazón.]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_37"><![CDATA[(La entrada del diario está escrita en una cursiva muy fina y elegante) Todo sucedió tan rápido. Nuestra admiración pronto pasó a horror cuando la bestia reveló que aún seguía viva. La criatura agarró la pierna del héroe con un férreo apretón. Lanzó al hombre al suelo, y con su otro puño demolió la cara del campeón. Un solo grito es todo lo que oímos cuando el mastodonte destrozó la cabeza del hombre salpicando sus sesos por los alrededores. Se incorporó lentamente, cubierto de los restos de su víctima.  El momento de shock pasó a pánico y angustia cuando el público, lloroso, empezó a clamar justicia.]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_38"><![CDATA[(La entrada del diario está escrita en una cursiva muy fina y elegante) El público entró en un frenesí de venganza y llamaron a gritos a los guardias. Yo me fui de allí rápidamente, pero lo último que vi fue a la bestia huyendo descontrolada de los domadores que intentaban dominarla. Aunque me abrí camino apresuradamente hacia fuera de las puertas del anfiteatro, podía seguir escuchando los frenéticos gritos de la muchedumbre y el temblor de la tierra. Ha sido interesante volver a mi ciudad natal, pero presiento que habrá disturbios y planeo irme antes de que me afecten.]]></entry>

    <entry id="journal_page_text_39"><![CDATA[Me han contado que mantener un diario podría ayudarme a evadir mi mente del pavor permanente al que invita este lugar desdichado, así que voy a empezarlo ahora. Nos han encargado explorar parte de la foresta, un lugar que me trae muchos recuerdos desagradables pero que conozco mejor que nadie. Estaré acompañada por Turid y Aldwin. Aunque Turid es descarado a veces y Aldwin temerario, forman un grupo efectivo y fiable. También nos han asignado una cara nueva, una que me inquieta...]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_40"><![CDATA[Nos hemos embarcado en nuestra misión y ya tengo malos presentimientos. No ha pasado ni una hora desde que hemos partido y la nueva ya se está quejando. Demasiada caminata dice ella, está todo muy sucio dice también. Lo peor es que viene a la expedición vestida con una toga lujosa y blandiendo un espejo roto. ¿Cuál es su justificación para un equipamiento tan extraño? Ella dice que es "cómodo". Nunca entenderé a estos urbanitas...]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_41"><![CDATA[Nuestro primer encuentro en este lugar miserable casi acaba en desastre, pero la recluta se recuperó. Parece que ella es una especie de bruja, usó su espejo roto para conjurar algún tipo de magia curativa. Dejó a Turid fresco como una lechuga después de que fuera apuñalado por un cultista. Aldwin simpatiza con ella, pero yo tengo mis sospechas...]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_42"><![CDATA[Todo va muy bien. Me siento y escribo mientras descansamos alrededor de la hoguera del campamento. La dama bruja intercambia piropos con Turid, se dicen basura que nunca entenderé. He de admitirlo, incluso para una damisela criada en ciudades, es extraordinariamente bella. Su piel es perfecta y su voz reconfortante. Lo único de ella que da mala espina es su maldito espejo. Está hecho añicos, gastado y arañado como si fuera mucho más viejo que ella. Es muy extraño...]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_43"><![CDATA[Los malditos bandidos nos emboscaron por la noche. Era un grupo diferente al que yo pertenecía, pero su comportamiento no era distinto. El pobre Aldwin fue la primera víctima, uno de esos brutos le apuñaló justo en la barriga y tiró, abriéndole en canal. Murió tendido sobre una piscina de su propia sangre. Antes de que pudiera incluso agarrar mi arco, uno de sus arqueros acribilló mi brazo. Estaba hecha polvo, no sería útil para nadie en este estado. Fueron derechos a por la bruja, la pobre se acaba de levantar. Pensé que sería su fin, pero no podía estar más equivocada...]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_44"><![CDATA[La maldita bruja soltó su espejo para revelar su auténtica y horrorosa forma. Un revoltijo de tentáculos y fauces, lanzando escupitajos y chillando a los que serían sus asaltantes. Turid huyó gritando sólo con la visión de aquella cosa. Cuando uno de los degolladores alcanzó de un tajo a la criatura, ella reaccionó con una rapidez imposible vomitando bilis pútrida por sus múltiples bocas. Los pobres idiotas agonizaban a gritos mientras la carne fundida se desprendía de sus huesos y todo lo que dejó cada uno fue un charco de sangre hirviente. Fue suficiente para que el resto de la banda de matones huyera despavorida, y en aquel momento la monstruosidad me dirigió una mirada penetrante. Por puro instinto salí corriendo tan rápido como pude, hacia la oscuridad...]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_45"><![CDATA[Los flechazos del brazo se han infectado. Tengo alucinaciones. Mi maldito pájaro huyó durante aquel encuentro terrible y aún no ha vuelto. Solo puedo asumir que Turid ha sufrido el mismo destino que Aldwin. Pensar que este sería el modo en que acabaría, acurrucada debajo de un árbol turbada por los recuerdos de aquella criatura innombrable. Pensaba que me había redimido de mis pecados, pero muero olvidada como una más de incontables almas. Pensé que estaba lista para luchar contra los horrores, pero ahora que los conozco mejor...]]></entry>

    <entry id="journal_page_text_53"><![CDATA[Mi última cacería me ha llevado a la gran ciudad. Esta presa va a ser esquiva: su comportamiento sugiere que prefiere la manipulación al enfrentamiento directo. Dada la degeneración de la población será difícil identificarla, pero no desistiré en mi busca. La luz me guía.]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_54"><![CDATA[He localizado a la bruja. Había sobreestimado su inteligencia: su naturaleza arrogante y su repugnante alarde han hecho el trabajo por sí solos. Habiendo denunciado la dimensión de su degeneración ante toda la ciudad la caza ya puede dar comienzo.]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_55"><![CDATA[La criatura había huido a las cochambrosas chozas que brotan en lo más oscuro de la ciudad. No podía permitir que semejante abominación siguiera existiendo. Hice lo correcto y prendí fuego a los oscuros suburbios. Sin ningún lugar para huir, finalmente ha pagado por sus pecados...]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_56"><![CDATA[Encontraron muchos cadáveres carbonizados entre los restos. Son irreconocibles, pero estoy seguro de que la bruja está entre ellos. A pesar de lo radical de mi acción, la población no parece preocuparse mucho por los muertos entre las llamas. Como yo, estoy seguro de que ellos ven la pérdida de esa muchedumbre como un sacrificio necesario para destruir al mal. Así, con otro monstruo fuera de combate puedo proseguir en mi cruzada contra la corrupción.]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_57"><![CDATA[¡Esta acción me conseguirá un puesto en la historia como héroe de la luz! Hemos capturado a la bruja herética que fragmentaba a nuestra fe. Seré el responsable del ajusticiamiento y mi sentencia es clara: no hay mejor castigo para los falsos profetas que el sufrimiento en el fuego sagrado.]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_58"><![CDATA[He visto la bruja con mis propios ojos y he observado pura corrupción. No hay duda de que esta criatura es la responsable de dividir a nuestra fe en distintas facciones enemigas entre sí. En apariencia adora a la luz como nosotros, pero yo puedo ver más allá de sus ardides. Pronto daré comienzo a la purga.]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_59"><![CDATA[¡Nunca antes había visto una abominación como ella! Ha extinguido como si nada las llamas sagradas de la pira y se ha proclamado la elegida de la luz. Ha embrujado a todo el mundo con sus mentiras apoteósicas. Así, he visto con horror como tanto campesinos como cruzados de la luz se inclinaban ante sus profecías profanas. He conseguido huir de ese horrible espectáculo para advertir a los que todavía conserven su pureza de la corrupción acechante.]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_60"><![CDATA[Una pesadilla hecha realidad. La criatura es demasiado fuerte y ahora estamos condenados a adorarla como a una semidiosa. He sido excomulgado de una fe que antaño luchaba contra la oscuridad, pero ahora es un culto que adora a una aciaga parodia de un ángel. Incluso ahora, en la derrota, no detendré mi caza. Este engendro debe morir, o la humanidad será condenada por toda la eternidad.]]></entry>

    <entry id="journal_page_text_61"><![CDATA[Nuestro plan está en marcha. Ya no seremos el reino más débil. Los malvados marinos occidentales y los belicistas norteños tendrán una razón para temernos. Sabrán que somos los gobernantes legítimos de estas tierras. Somos seres perfectos, así que nuestro destino es gobernarlos a todos.]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_62"><![CDATA[La belleza puede encontrarse en los lugares más inverosímiles. En nuestros viajes a través del entorno rural campesino, nos tropezamos con dos hermosas flores. Copias perfectas la una de la otra, con una belleza y elegancia que no eran naturales. No era justo dejar algo tan precioso en la inmundicia con la gente corriente, así que nos las llevamos. Serían la quintaesencia de nuestro plan.]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_63"><![CDATA[Ellas adoptaron rápidamente nuestras costumbres. Son una leyenda hecha carne. Las Flores Gemelas, una entrenada en la guerra, la otra entrenada en la diplomacia. Su técnica carece de fallos, totalmente perfeccionada, y estamos ansiosos de que más discípulos sigan su senda. Nuestro ejército toma forma rápidamente. En unos años tendremos un ejército de guerreros perfectos, entrenados por la misma dualidad corpórea de la perfección.]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_64"><![CDATA[Han pasado meses de rigurosos entrenamientos, pero ya empezamos a ver los resultados. Las Flores Gemelas entrenando a nuestros soldados mortales los han vuelto discípulos dignos de los dioses. La guerrera es estricta, selectiva, solo entrena a hombres jóvenes con la piel tan perfecta como la suya. Dicer que su técnica solo puede ser acompañada por la belleza sobrenatural. No dudamos de ella, pero no alcanzamos a comprender del todo las lecciones de un ser perfecto. Muchos soldados han caído en el intenso entrenamiento, pero sabemos que los que sobrevivan y perseveren ascenderán, y derrotarán a nuestros enemigos.]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_65"><![CDATA[¡El plan llevaba desarrollándose décadas, y finalmente podemos recolectar los frutos de nuestro labor! La presentación de las Flores Gemelas fue majestuosa. El reino norteño no pudo contener nuestro asalto. La Guerrera era tan grácil como bella. Bailaba a través del campo de batalla, pintando el albero con la sangre de nuestros enemigos y nuestros soldados perfectos la seguían en su camino. Nuestro ejército sin defectos triunfó aquel día y triunfará muchos otros más. Nuestros enemigos conocerán finalmente el miedo, y se inclinarán ante nosotros con el tiempo. Nos preparamos para celebrarlo, esta noche será por siempre recordada.]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_66"><![CDATA[Nos ha ocurrido una tragedia espantosa. Las Flores Gemelas ya no existen. Una de ellas fue encontrada, rodeada de los cadáveres de nuestros mejores soldados, desnuda y extendida sobre una piscina de su propia sangre. No pudimos encontrar a la otra Flor. Maldiciones de venganza estaban escritas por toda la habitación, posiblemente algún tipo de hechicería de nuestro enemigo más odiado. Sabían que no podían combatirnos directamente, así que enviaron infiltrados para matarnos cuando éramos más vulnerables. Pero no será nuestro fin. Encontraremos a la Flor perdida y reconstruiremos nuestro ejército.]]></entry>

    <entry id="journal_page_text_67"><![CDATA[Maldita sea, una de las damiselas se ha escapado. Ascot ha debido de atar mal los nudos y ahora la muchacha está fuera por los bosques, ese idiota. Madre me envía con Jarret y Mavis para rastrearla. No sorprende, la verdad. Las acciones de un patán descerebrado me han arruinado el día. A lo mejor podría apuñalarle en el escroto para darle una lección cuando regrese.]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_68"><![CDATA[Hemos encontrado a la doncella, pero Jarret y Mavis se dejaron llevar por la caza y mataron a la chica. Vaya fastidio. Volví a Madre para contárselo inmediatamente. Ella estaba furiosa. Nos reunió a todos nosotros cuando Jarret y Mavis volvieron para darnos un ejemplo con ellos. “Una vida por una vida”, dice ella siempre. Hizo luchar a muerte a los dos. Acabaron matándose el uno al otro. Jarret fue eviscerado en el abdomen y Mavis murió por una fractura craneal. Una escena repugnante, pero dos imbéciles menos con los que discutir.]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_69"><![CDATA[Madre me envía a otra caza. Esta vez vamos a secuestrar a una de esas "exóticas" mujeres del Este. Van a pasar por aquí pronto y soy la encargada de localizarla. Esa cucaracha inútil de Ascot viene también. Es solo peso muerto para mí. Al menos será un buen señuelo..]]></entry>	
    <entry id="journal_page_text_70"><![CDATA[Conseguimos secuestrar a la chica, pero con un gran coste. Los malditos guardias usaron algún tipo de técnica militar extranjera, nada que hubiera visto antes. Nos pillaron por sorpresa, pero les superábamos en número. Ascot murió en la emboscada, lo único bueno que pasó. La maldita muchacha no dice nada que tenga sentido para mí, habla en una lengua extranjera. Tuve que abofetearla para que se calmara. Espero que esta sea digna de lo que sea que Madre quiera. Es más trabajo del que preferiría para un solo día, y me está poniendo de mal humor.]]></entry>	
    <entry id="journal_page_text_71"><![CDATA[Se la hemos llevado a Madre, y nos ha enviado a reunirnos con el grupo que preguntó por esta ovejita extranjera en primer lugar. Son una panda de nobles. Su líder ha "adquirido" gusto por bienes importados y nos ofrece cantidades copiosas de comida, armas, armaduras, cualquier cosa que queramos por esta frágil cosita. Estaré allí para supervisar el intercambio.]]></entry>	
    <entry id="journal_page_text_72"><![CDATA[¡Esa excusa despreciable de ganado humano!. Esa viciosa de ojos rasgados me agarró de mi maldita capucha. La noqueé para que se arrodillara inmediatamente como la ramera que era y se golpeó su preciosa cabecita con una mesa. Ahora tengo su sangre manchando mis manos y Madre quiere venganza. He huido de allí tan rápido como he podido. No voy a morir por una pequeña debilucha depravada.]]></entry>	
    <entry id="journal_page_text_73"><![CDATA[Han pasado semanas, probablemente incluso meses. Ya he perdido la cuenta desde la primera vez que las partidas de caza me encontraron. Esa bruja loca nunca olvida un agravio. "Una vida por una vida." Nada más que una tontería perturbada de esa bruja. Nunca creí en sus enseñanzas, solo estaba allí por mi propio beneficio. Ahora manda más y más matones a por mí. Soy mejor que todos ellos. He acumulado una cuenta de muertes que deberían temer, y no hace más que crecer con cada peligroso encuentro.]]></entry>	
    <entry id="journal_page_text_74"><![CDATA[Esto es cansino. La arpía psicótica sigue enviando más y más de los suyos para cazarme. No puedo vivir así, en constante peligro por la próxima emboscada. Es hora de que encuentre un lugar dónde esconderme. A lo mejor una vida de mercenaria para una familia noble bastaría. Y lo mejor es que esos idiotas pomposos morirán en mi lugar cuando llegue la hora, después de todo...]]></entry>

Nos han atado a todas, listas para cualquier destino cruel que quieran infligirnos. Son esclavistas. He oído lo que le ocurrió a los clanes vecinos, y nos hemos convertido en sus próximas víctimas. Rezo para que nos rescaten pronto, no puedo imaginar que será de mí en este lugar infernal.]]></entry>	
    <entry id="journal_page_text_76"><![CDATA[(La página está sucia y es difícilmente legible) Nos tratan peor que al ganado. Nos dan basura para comer y no nos dejan asearnos. Las mujeres que no han sido vendidas están aquí conmigo, pudriéndose y deseando la muerte. Los pájaros dan vueltas a nuestro alrededor, ansiosos por darse un festín con nuestros cuerpos rotos, pero siento una conexión con ellos. Han preguntado por un sacrificio a cambio de la libertad. Quieren saber que estaría dispuesta a dar. Las otras gritan y les patean para alejarlos, pero yo dejo que se me acerquen. Han preguntado por la carne de mi brazo, a cambio aflojarán mis ataduras. He aceptado.]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_77"><![CDATA[(La página está sucia y es difícilmente legible) Liberada de mis ataduras, no he liberado a las demás. Ellas han rechazado los regalos de la Bandada y no merecen las bendiciones que se me han concedido. He dejado un reguero de cadáveres a medida que me abría camino hacía el líder de este grupo esclavista, la primera de muchas ofrendas a mi nueva familia. Cuando finalmente encuentre a su líder no vacilaré en arrancarle los ojos y dejarle como mi ofrenda final para el primer festín de mi Bandada.]]></entry>	
    <entry id="journal_page_text_78"><![CDATA[(La página está sucia y es difícilmente legible) Para los que he dejado en paz, les ofrecí una elección simple. Quédate en las filas de nuestra Bandada, o niégate y serás nuestra ofrenda. Muchos se negaron, y fueron castigados ejemplarmente. Para los que se quedaron, dejé claro lo que defendíamos. El ciclo de la vida y la muerte es todo lo que importa. Una vida por una vida es el coste de la transgresión. Cada muerte es una ofrenda, y siempre y cuando se respete esta regla, respetaré su forma de vida sea la que sea. Somos pastores para los débiles, y los que no sean dignos serán una ofrenda para nuestra Bandada.]]></entry>

    <entry id="journal_page_text_29"><![CDATA[(Il diario è redatto in un corsivo elegante e sottile) A chiunque stia leggendo. Questo è un diario personale. Vi chiedo di astenervi nell'andare avanti e restituire l'oggetto al suo proprietario. Potete trovarmi seguendo la mappa inclusa. Vi ringrazio. Firmato, Euryale (allegata, c'è una mappa dettagliata del Borgo. Purtroppo, le indicazioni sono macchiate e illeggibili)]]></entry>

    <entry id="journal_page_text_30"><![CDATA[(Il diario è redatto in un corsivo elegante e sottile) È passato molto tempo dall'ultima volta che ho messo in piede in questa meravigliosa città. Molto è cambiato durante la mia assenza. Gli sporchi schiavi sono spariti, sostituiti da uomini e donne allegri, impegnati a discutere dell'ultima battaglia nell'arena del re. Parlano di un valoroso campione che combatterà nell'arena proprio oggi. Ho ignorato il chiacchiericcio, ma col tempo sentivo sempre più persone parlare delle gesta eroiche del campione. Ora che la mia curiosità era stata destata, sarei andata al circo ad assistere allo spettacolo.]]></entry>

    <entry id="journal_page_text_31"><![CDATA[(Il diario è redatto in un corsivo elegante e sottile) Tipico. Mentre andavo all'arena, ho sbagliato strada e sono finita nei sobborghi della città, la zone dove vivono individui rozzi e senza scrupoli. Come era prevedibile, sono stata fermata da un gruppo di questi bruti che hanno cercato di derubarmi. Mani invasive e parole offensive cominciarono a toccarmi in posti dove non avrebbero dovuto. Seguirono una serie di fatti spiacevoli che occuparono più tempo del dovuto. L'osannato eroe sarebbe sceso nell'arena a momenti, quindi raccolsi velocemente il mio specchio e mi diressi allo stadio.]]></entry>

    <entry id="journal_page_text_32"><![CDATA[(Il diario è redatto in un corsivo elegante e sottile) Sono arrivata appena in tempo per l'inizio dello scontro. Fortunatamente una delle guardia è stata così gentile da scortarmi ad un posto dove avrei potuto godermi tutta la vista. I cancelli si aprirono e un uomo emerse dall'oscurità, mentre la folla andava in visibilio.]]></entry>

    <entry id="journal_page_text_33"><![CDATA[(Il diario è redatto in un corsivo elegante e sottile) Il pubblico urlava eccitato. Il guerriero era la perfezione incarnata. Il suo corpo scolpito era quello di un uomo che aveva visto numerose battaglie mentre i lunghi e morbidi capelli erano quelli di una divinità. In una mano teneva una rete e nell'altra un tridente decorato. Era così perfetto da farmi credere che avesse ottenuto quella bellezza attraverso rituali oscuri, come feci io.]]></entry>

    <entry id="journal_page_text_34"><![CDATA[(Il diario è redatto in un corsivo elegante e sottile) Tra le urla del pubblico, l'avversario entrò nell'arena. Sul lato opposto dell'anfiteatro, un cancello arrugginito si aprì ed emerse un colosso mostruoso, trascinato dalle catene degli addestratori. Era una creatura uscita da un libro di fiabe per bambini. Una massa di carne coperta di spuntoni arrugginiti e cicatrici. I cittadini salutarono la bestia con risate di scherno e insulti volgari. Nonostante la temibile bestia, il campione non mostrò la minima paura, ma sogghignò confidente.]]></entry>

    <entry id="journal_page_text_35"><![CDATA[(Il diario è redatto in un corsivo elegante e sottile) Gli addestratori liberarono la bestia e la battaglia cominciò. All'inizio ero dubbiosa. Il mostro era alto come dieci uomini e la terra tremava al suo passaggio. Come poteva un semplice uomo sperare di sconfiggerla? Ma con mia sorpresa, l'eroe sembrava cavarsela. Il combattimento somigliava ad una danza, in cui l'agile guerriero piroettava attorno ai goffi attacchi dell'orco. Rispondeva ai colpi con precisione micidiale e gli volteggiava attorno mentre la bestia ottusa colpiva l'aria in preda alla frustrazione.]]></entry>

    <entry id="journal_page_text_36"><![CDATA[(Il diario è redatto in un corsivo elegante e sottile) In maniera spettacolare, il campione affondò il tridente nel cuore del mostro, il sangue schizzò lontano e la folla impazzì. Con un tonfo sordo, la creatura collassò e il suo sangue nero ammorbidì il terreno. La folla continuava a festeggiare e ad applaudire mentre l'eroe si godeva le ovazioni. Si avvicinò alla creatura ed appoggiò piede sulla sua testa, in posa eroica. Salutò la folla e potrei giurare che mi fece l'occhiolino. In quel momento, il mio cuore saltò un battito.]]></entry>

    <entry id="journal_page_text_37"><![CDATA[(Il diario è redatto in un corsivo elegante e sottile) È successo tutto in un istante. L'ammirazione si trasformò in orrore in un battito di ciglia, quando ci rendemmo conto che la bestia era ancora viva. Afferrò la gamba dell'eroe in una stretta di ferro. Lo trascinò  a terra e con l'altro pugno sfondò il volto dell'eroe. Udimmo un rantolo mentre la bestia colpiva la testa dell'uomo e brandelli di carne volavano ovunque. Lentamente si alzò, coperto dalle viscere della vittima. Il momento di shock mutò in panico e furia. La folla bramava giustizia.]]></entry>

    <entry id="journal_page_text_38"><![CDATA[(Il diario è redatto in un corsivo elegante e sottile) La folla bramava vendetta, violenta e inarrestabile, richiamando l'attenzione delle guardie. Mi allontanai velocemente e l'ultima cosa che vidi era la bestia che attaccava gli addestratori. Potevo ancora sentire le urla della folla e la terra che tremava mentre attraversavo i cancelli dell'anfiteatro. È stato bello ritornare nella mia città natale, ma si può sentire l'aria di rivolta e non ho intenzione di rimanere coinvolta.]]></entry>

    <entry id="journal_page_text_39"><![CDATA[Mi è stato detto che tenere un diario può aiutarmi a tenere lontana la mente dall'orrore che permea questo luogo. Perchè non provarci. Ci è stato affidato il compito di esplorare una porzione di landa, un luogo che riporta alla memoria molti ricordi spiacevoli e uno più degli altri. Sarò accompagnata da Turid e Aldwin. Sebbene Turid può essere imprudente a volte e Aldwin avventato, formano comunque una compagnia forte ed affidabile. Ci è stata assegnata una nuova recluta, di cui non mi fido...]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_40"><![CDATA[Siamo partiti. Ho una pessima sensazione. Non è passata nemmeno un'ora e la recluta si sta già lamentando. È stanca, dice, si è sporcata. Ma la cosa peggiore è che il suo equipaggiamento è formato da una veste costosa e uno specchio rotto. Che motivo ci sarà dietro tale armamentario? Lei dice che è "comodo". Non capirò mai questa gente di città...]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_41"><![CDATA[Il nostro primo scontro in questo posto dimenticato dalla Luce è quasi finito in disastro, ma la recluta se l'è cavata. È una strega, usa il suo specchio spezzato per una qualche magia curativa. Quando Turid è stato accoltellato da un cultista, lo ha sistemato in un momento. Aldwin sembra averla presa in simpatia, ma io continuo a non fidarmi...]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_42"><![CDATA[La spedizione procede bene. Scrivo mentre siamo seduti attorno al bivacco. La strega si sta scambiando complimenti con Turid, che sciocchezze incomprensibili. Devo ammettere, anche per una donzelletta cresciuta in città, è straordinariamente bella. La pelle perfetta e la voce suadente. L'unica cosa sbagliata è quel maledetto specchio. Spezzato e graffiato come se fosse più antico di lei. Che strano...]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_43"><![CDATA[Dannati briganti, ci hanno teso una trappola durante la notte. Non erano gli stessi di cui facevo parte ma non erano così differenti. Il povero Aldwin fu il primo a cadere, uno di quei bruti lo ha squartato come un maiale. È morto in una pozza del suo stesso sangue. Prima che potessi impugnare l'arco uno dei loro fucilieri mi distrusse il braccio. Completamente maciullato, non sarò di alcuna utilità in queste condizioni. Poi puntarono la strega, la poverina si era appena svegliata...]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_44"><![CDATA[La strega maledetta lasciò cadere lo specchio per rivelare la sua vera, orribile forma. Una massa di tentacoli, fauci e bava, che attaccò gli assalitori con uno strillo ultraterreno. Turid scappò urlante non appena la vide. Quando uno dei tagliagole tentò di attaccare la creatura, essa si spostò con una velocità impossibile e vomitò una putrida bile da una delle sue molteplici bocche. Il poveretto urlò agonizzante mentre la carne si scioglieva dalle ossa finché tutto ciò che rimase di lui, era una pozza di sangue ribollente. Fu sufficiente a far fuggire la banda di malviventi. La bestia voltò il suo sguardo verso di me. L'istinto prese il sopravvento e fuggii il più velocemente possibile nell'oscurità...]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_45"><![CDATA[La ferita si è infettata. Ho le allucinazioni. Quel dannato uccello è volato via e non è tornato. Posso solo immaginare che Turid abbia fatto la stessa fine di Aldwin. Pensare che morirò così, rannicchiata contro un albero, tormentata dal ricordo di quella bestia innominabile. Pensavo che sarei riuscita ad assolvere i miei peccati e invece morirò abbandonata come innumerevoli altre povere anime. Pensavo di essere pronta ad affrontare questi orrori ma ora capisco che non è così...]]></entry>

    <entry id="journal_page_text_53"><![CDATA[I tracked my latest hunt to the grand city. This one will be illusive, its behaviour suggests that it prefers manipulation over direct confrontation. It'll be difficult to identify the creature, given the degeneracy of this city's populace, but I will not give up my search. The Light guides me.]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_54"><![CDATA[I've found the hag. I over-estimated its intelligence, it had made itself easy to find based on its arrogant nature and abhorrent flaunting. I've announced its debaucheries to the entirety of the city populace and the hunt will soon begin.]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_55"><![CDATA[The creature fled into the foul shantytowns that sit in the city's shadow. I cannot allow such a thing to exist, so I set the entirety of the corrupted dwellings ablaze. With nowhere to run, it will surely burn for its sins.]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_56"><![CDATA[Many charred corpses were found amongst the aftermath. They are unrecognizable but I am sure that the witch can be included among them. Despite my radical actions, the cityfolk do not seem to care for those lost in the fire. Surely they must understand as I do that the loss of these peasants is a small price to pay for the eradication of evil. And so, with another monster put down for good, I continue my crusade against corruption.]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_57"><![CDATA[This will surely mark me down in the manuscripts as a hero of the Light! We have captured the heretical witch that had splintered our faith. I will be responsible for her execution, and there is no punishment more fitting for a false prophet than death by holy fire.]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_58"><![CDATA[To see the witch with my own eyes is to know pure corruption. There is no doubt that this thing is responsible for splitting the faithful followers of the Light into conflicted factions. It speaks as if it is a disciple of the Light like us, but I see through her ruse. I will commence the burning shortly.]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_59"><![CDATA[It is an abomination unlike any I've encountered! It extinguished the sanctioned fires of the pyre with ease and presented itself as an avatar of the Flame. It had converted all around me to its falsified fate and I watched in horror as both peasants and crusaders of the Light bowed in unison to this creature of debased prophecies. I retreated from its deformed presence, and now I must warn those that are still pure of its corrupting nature.]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_60"><![CDATA[The worst thing has come to reality. The creature proved too strong, and now all have come to worship it as a demigod. I have been excommunicated from what was once a faith that fought the darkness but now is a cult praising a thing that mockingly resembles an angel. Even in the face of defeat, I will not stop my hunt. This thing must die, or mankind will be damned for eternity.]]></entry>

    <entry id="journal_page_text_61"><![CDATA[Our plan is in motion. No longer will we be the weakest of the kingdoms. The sea fiends of the west and the warmongers of the north will fear us. They will know that we are the rightful rulers of this land. We are perfect beings, so it is our destiny to rule over all.]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_62"><![CDATA[Beauty can be found in the most unlikely of places. On our travels through the peasant countryside, we stumbled upon two perfect flowers. Mirror copies of each other, with unnatural beauty and poise. It is not right to leave something so precious in the filth of the common people, so we took them in. They will be a quintessential piece to our plan.]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_63"><![CDATA[They took quickly to our ways. They are a legend born in flesh. The Twin Flowers, one that trains in war, another that trains in diplomacy. Their technique is flawless, perfected, and we are eager to see disciples follow their ways. Our army forms quickly. Within years, we will have an army of perfect warriors, trained by the dual embodiment of perfection.]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_64"><![CDATA[It has been months of rigorous training, but we are beginning to see results. The Twin Flowers are training our mortal soldiers into godly disciples. The Warrior is a strict, selective, only training young men with skin as flawless as hers. She says that her technique must be matched with unearthly beauty. We do not doubt her, for we cannot begin to comprehend the lessons of a perfect being. Many soldiers have fallen from the intense training, but we know that those that survive and persevere will ascend, and vanquish our foes.]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_65"><![CDATA[This plan was decades in the making, and finally the fruits of our labor can be harvested! The Twin Flowers’ first performance was grandeur. The north kingdom could not withstand our assault. The Warrior was as graceful as she is beautiful. Dancing across the battlefield, painting the dirt with our foes’ blood as our perfect soldiers followed in her path. Our flawless army triumphed this day and they will triumph for many more. Our enemies will finally know fear, and they will bow to us in time. We prepare for celebration, tonight will be a night remembered forever.]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_66"><![CDATA[A terrible tragedy has befell us. The Twin Flowers are no more. One was found, surrounded by the corpses of our finest warriors, naked and splayed out in a pool of her own blood. The other Flower was nowhere to be found. Spiteful maledictions were posted all around the room, surely some sorcery by our most hated enemy. They knew they couldn’t fight us directly, so they sent infiltrators to kill us when we were most vulnerable. This will not be our end. We will find the lost flower, and we will rebuild our army. ]]></entry>

    <entry id="journal_page_text_67"><![CDATA[Damn it, one of the damsels escaped. Ascot must have tied the knots wrong and now the wench is out in the woods, that idiot. Mother is sending me with Jarret and Mavis to track her down. It is unsurprising, really. My day ruined by the actions of a brain dead oaf. Maybe I’ll stab him in the sack to teach him a lesson once I return.]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_68"><![CDATA[We found the maiden, but Jarret and Mavis got carried away with the hunt and killed the girl. Irritating. I returned to Mother immediately to tell her. She was furious. She gathered up the lot of us after Jarret and Mavis returned to make an example of them. “A life for a life”, she always says. Had the two of them fight to the death. They ended up killing each other. Jarret had his guts splayed out while Mavis got his skull crushed. Gruesome scene, but that’s two more jackasses I won’t have to deal with.]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_69"><![CDATA[I am being sent by Mother on another hunt. This time we’re taking us one of those “exotic” women from the east. They’re passing through here soon and I am in charge of tracking this one. That useless cockroach Ascot is coming along. He is only dead weight to me. He will be good fodder at the very least.]]></entry>	
    <entry id="journal_page_text_70"><![CDATA[We got the girl, but at heavy cost. The damn guards used some foreign fighting technique, nothing I’ve ever seen before. Caught us off guard but we outnumbered them. Ascot died in the ambush, only good thing to come of this. The damn wench doesn’t even speak sense, talking in some foreign tongue. Had to slap some quiet into her. This one better be worth whatever Mother is getting. This is more work than I prefer in a single day, and it is putting me in a worse mood.]]></entry>	
    <entry id="journal_page_text_71"><![CDATA[We brought her back to Mother, and she sent us to meet up with the lot that asked for this foreign sheep in the first place. A bunch of nobles they are. The head of them has an “acquired” taste for imported goods and is offering us bountiful amounts of food, weapons, armor, whatever we want, for this fragile thing. I will be there to oversee the trade. ]]></entry>	
    <entry id="journal_page_text_72"><![CDATA[That contemptible whorish excuse for human cattle. That slit-eyed profligate grabbed hold of my damned hood. I knocked her right off her feet like the harlot she is and she hit her pretty little head on a table. Now her blood is on my hands and Mother wants revenge. I ran as fast as I could out of there. I am not dying for some debauched little waif.]]></entry>	
    <entry id="journal_page_text_73"><![CDATA[It has been weeks, maybe even months. I lost track ever since the first hunting parties found me. That crazed hag never forgets a grudge. “A life for a life.” Nothing but deranged drivel from that witch. I never believed in her preachings, I was just in it for my own gain. Now she’s sending more and more thugs to take my head. I am better than all of them. I’ve racked up a kill count that should be feared, and it only grows with each perilous encounter.]]></entry>	
    <entry id="journal_page_text_74"><![CDATA[This is tiring. That psychotic harpy continues to send more and more of her kin to hunt me down. I cannot live like this, in constant peril of the next ambush. It is time that I find a place to hide. Maybe life as a mercenary for a noble family will suffice. Best that those pompous fools die instead me when the time comes, after all...]]></entry>

    <entry id="journal_page_text_75"><![CDATA[(The page is dirty and hardly eligible) They slaughtered all the men. My husband, my brother, even my own son. They have us all tied up, ready for whatever cruel fate they wish to inflict on us. They are slavers. I have heard of what happened to the neighboring clans, and we have become their next victims. I pray that we will be rescued soon, I cannot imagine what will become of me in this hellish place.]]></entry>	
    <entry id="journal_page_text_76"><![CDATA[(The page is dirty and hardly eligible) They treat us worse than cattle. We are given dirt to eat and left soiled. The women that have not been sold off are here with me, rotting away and wishing for death. The birds surround us, eager to feast on our broken bodies, but I feel a connection. They ask for a sacrifice in exchange for freedom. They want to know that I am willing to give. The others yell and kick them away, but I allow them to approach me. They ask for my arm’s flesh, and in exchange they will loosen my bonds. I accept.]]></entry>
    <entry id="journal_page_text_77"><![CDATA[(The page is dirty and hardly eligible) Released of my bonds, I did not free the others. They refused the gifts of the flock and do not deserve the blessings I was bestowed. I carved a path of bodies as I made my way to the leader of this slavers’ group, the first of many offerings I will make to my new found family. When I finally found their leader, I did not hesitate to gouge his eyes out and leave him as one final offering for the first feast of my flock.]]></entry>	
    <entry id="journal_page_text_78"><![CDATA[(The page is dirty and hardly eligible) As for those left, I gave them a simple choice. Stay and become part of our flock, or deny us and become our offering. Many refused, and were made examples of. For those who stayed, I made it clear what we stood for. The cycle of life and death is all that matters. A life for a life is the cost for transgression. Every death is an offering, and so long as that one rule is kept, I will respect their way of life. We are shepherds for the weak, and those deemed unworthy will become an offering to our flock.]]></entry>
